Vehicles are noisy and break down on a regular basis, the interiors are crowded, and the drivers can be very rude. On top of that, with recent budget cuts the fares keep rising. But the system is extensive and will eventually get you where you need to go.\\n\\n===By car===\\nTraffic is surprisingly light, given that road blockages can be cleared by just swimming up and over. Seahorse carriages are available, but are expensive and more of a tourist attraction than a legitimate way to get around.\\n\\n==See==\\n[[Image:Parthenon_acropolis.jpg|thumb|250px|Panposeidium]]\\n* \\'\\'\\'Ancient Greek architecture\\'\\'\\' - from palaces to amphitheaters, well preserved.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Panposeidium\\'\\'\\' - the presidential palace.

With its heritage of Brutalist concrete architecture intermixed with the spices and mayhem of the South Seas, Bodoni presents a bold face to \\nthe world and to the curious traveler.\\n\\n[[Image:Unarizaki PineappleHouse.JPG|thumb|400px|The Pineapple House, a local landmark]]\\n\\n==Understand==\\n\\n\\n\\n==Get in==\\n\\n===By plane===\\n\\n'''National Hero Antonio Bourgeois International Airport''' (IATA code: '''NHB''') is located just outside the city limits.  It's a bit too far to walk, so consider hiring a donqtuque to take you there.\\n\\n===By car===\\n\\nIf you want to get here by car, your car's wheels must be strong enough because there are many sharp stones on the city streets.\\n\\n===By bus===\\n\\nThere is only one bus service every day connecting the city hall and the mayor's official residence.\\n\\n===By boat===\\n\\nYour boat must be strong enough and not attract the sharks.\\n\\n==Get around==\\nBecause of the small number of taxis (the only 4 licences are held by the President's sons), it is very difficult to catch one. Fights are very common and are encouraged by government as a way to solve disputes. The last man standing has the right to use the taxi. Unfortunately two of President's sons have a passion for gambling so don't be surprised if they lose the taxi at it while you're fighting.\\n\\n==See==\\n\\n* '''Pilcrow Palace''', 61 Avenida do Plenk.  An architectural landmark shaped like the letter P, painted in imposing shades of gray and constructed on the order of General Pica.  Now open to the public, sights inside include the mirror-lined '''Combat Duty Bedroom of the General''' and the grim '''Disco Inferno''', where political dissidents were subjected to reruns of ''Saturday Night Fever'' until they broke down and confessed.  Open alternate Tuesdays from 9:45 to 10:30 AM, admission 200 dR.\\n* '''Hai Phen''', avenida do Bahia Tilde (''go the end of the trolley line, then join up with the beginning''). Bodoni's Little Chinatown, the Hai Phen district features many different kinds of spicey and ginger-scented swarfega prepared in Chinese style. Legal and gray-market CDs and DVDs are available, but be careful: many are region 8 encoded and dubbed over in Goudy.\\n\\n==Do==\\n*'''Bodoni Theatre of the Incomprehensible''', 15 Avenida du Enigma. Actors perform on a giant scrabble board while the audience plays scrabble. Words from any of San Serriffe's many languages are allowed. As each word forms, the actors weave it into the story and continue the performance. The performance is known as a '''Play on Words'''. Tickets 125 dRn. (''Includes a complementary bottle of Plenque'')\\n\\n==Learn==\\n\\n==Work==\\n\\n==Buy==\\n[[Image:Chipata_Market_Beans.JPG|thumb|Shopping at the Bean Market]]\\n\\n* '''Bean Market''' (''Mercado do Feij\\xe3o'').  Popular among souvenir-shoppers, this market offers a wide selection of white beans, violet beans, purple beans and, on festive occasions, small dried fish.  Haggling is necessary.  It's advisable to visit the market in the morning, as in the afternoon the merchants' lunches start to digest and air quality tends to deteriorate.\\n\\n* '''Pineapple House''', 42 Calle do Anan\\xe1s.  This distinctively-shaped building is a famed Bodonian landmark and nearly all tourists are dragged here by touts and/or the police at least twice per day.  Once inside, you have the choice of purchasing pineapple products like mashed pineapple, pineapple jam, pineapple wine (also available as an enema), etc.  Free entry, but getting out tends to be expensive.\\n\\n==Eat==\\nBodoni provides an excellent opportunity to take a break from a monotonous diet of mashed swarfega and try everybody's favorite root vegetable in stewed or deep-fried form instead.  There are persistent rumors of turnips and even the occasional potato being available on the black market and served in private rooms at high-end restaurants, but be discreet in your enquiries as possession of unlicensed foreign vegetables is a crime under Serriffean law.\\n\\n===Budget===\\n[[Image:Yashiya CaneSugarFactory.JPG|thumb|240px|A bowl of delicious swarfega stew at Swarfeg-o-Yum-Yum]]\\n\\n* '''Swarfeg-o-Yum-Yum''', 9 Calle do Explicatus.  This popular eatery specializes in a stew made from the distinctive local vegetable swarfega.  The dish was banned during the long reign of General Pica, when only mashed foods were permitted and soups were punishable by death, but societal restrictions have been loosened up recently and on weekend nights it can get so crowded that it's standing-room only &mdash; not that there are any tables or chairs anyway.  One bowl is more than enough for ten and costs just 10 dR.\\n\\n* '''Willy's on Wheels''', (''a mobile donqtuque which drives through the city'').  Serves pineapple deep fried in a stove hauled about the city at an astonishing rate in a donqtuque, much to the trepidation of pedestrians.  Considered a Bodoni institution for its undiminished service over the last three decades despite the best efforts of the health department.  15 dR for an entree, free if health inspectors arrive.\\n\\n===Mid-range===\\n* '''McObelus''', 69 Calle do Rebus (''and other outlets around town'').  While multinational chains have yet to enter the demanding San Serriffean market, the indigenous McObelus chain is often credited with bringing fast food culture to the islands.  Popular entrees include the ''Big Obelus'' burger with a patty of mashed, deep-fried swarfega and ''Bodoni Fries'', served with a dip of grease.\\n\\n===Splurge===\\n\\n==Drink==\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n[[Image:Sign VIPShed.JPG|thumb|240px|VIP Flophouse]]\\n\\n===Budget===\\n\\n* '''VIP Flophouse''', 42 Calle do Rebus, tel. ''+693''-33433337, [http://vipflophouse.co.ss].  A long-running backpacker favorite, originally built for long-term guests of General Pica.  Running water is provided in every room (when it rains) and the staff are all true Bodonis.  Dorm beds 500 dR/night (mattress not included).\\n\\n===Mid-range===\\n===Splurge===\\n\\nThe best way to stay here is staying at the presidential palace, but you have to contact the president first.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\n==Cope==\\n\\n==Go next==\\n\\n{{joke}}\\n{{isPartOf|Wikivoyage:Joke articles/Upper_Caisse}}\",\n",

You can try another way by sea but beware of the sharks because many sharks want to be your friends.\\n\\n==Get around==\\nYou can see shark palace in the bottom of the sea, but you have to have permission from immigration office.\\n\\n==See==\\nCocobanana Beach is, of course, famed for '''its vast expanse of white sand''' and its bevy of Serriffean lovelies wearing only '''Flong thongs''', a garment prepared from coconut husk that can also be used to remove pieces of swarfega from between your teeth.  It should, however, be noted that the Flong thongs are traditionally worn only by men who have passed the demanding initiation rites of the '''Very Brotherly Fraternity of the Homoglyph''', and women usually opt for burlap sacks, or go naked, instead.\\n\\nCocobanana has suffered somewhat from development recently, with some residents objecting that the '''giant boulders of rock''' dumped from the nearby quarry onto the beach detract from the scenic beauty.  However, protests have quieted down after mine management, yielding to public pressure in a sign of the times, gave residents the democratic option of having the boulders quarried to either the beach or on top of their huts.\\n\\n==Do==\\nYou can be sharks's friend by visiting them in their palace.\\n\\n==Buy==\\nThere is only one mall around here selling cattles.\\n\\n==Eat==\\nThere is no restaurant here, so you have to fish by yourself.\\n\\n==Drink==\\nYou can drink water from the wells.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n[[File:Sijungho Rest House. W\\u014fnsan Beach, North Korea.jpg|thumb|240px|Honeymoon Hideaway Suite at the Cocobanana Beach Resort]]\\nThere is only one hotel around here, but beware of the mosquitos.\\n\\n===Splurge===\\n* '''Cocobanana Beach Resort''', on National Highway 1, [http://cocobanana.com/].  Visitors to Cocobanana Beach Resort never cease to be amazed by its stunning appearance and the level of services available, and often leave with indelible memories of their experience.  For easy access, National Highway 1 runs right through the resort, and complimentary donkey carts to the beach (17 km away) are provided weekly.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\nBeware of locals with large sacks over their shoulder contacting you about purchase of foreign tubers. Remember: '''possession of foreign vegetables is a crime'''. Also, some of the local law enforcement officials pose as tuber salesmen to trap foreign visitors. If you are a victim of one of these traps, a payment offer 2,000dNr will normally allow you to go on your way (and you can keep the tubers).\\n\\n==Go next==\\nIf you want to get out fast from this place just call 911.\\n{{isPartOf|Wikivoyage:Joke articles/Upper_Caisse}}\\n{{joke}}\",\n",

But no one item is worth putting yourself and this project in legal jeopardy. If you have any questions about the source of something you want to put in Wikivoyage, [[Project:Using talk pages|ask about it first]]. \\'\\'\\'When in doubt, leave it out.\\'\\'\\'\\n\\n== Frequently asked questions ==\\n[[Image:Cc-by white.svg|thumb|150px|By = Attribution]]\\n\\n=== What do I need to do to get writing? ===\\n\\n\\'\\'Nothing!\\'\\' Just [[:en:Project:Plunge forward|plunge forward!]] Whenever you save something you write, you automatically license it for use under CC-by-SA 3.0. So all you need to do is get started writing&mdash;if the text is your own original writing, don\\'t worry about licenses.\\n\\n=== What do I need to do to get uploading images? ===\\n\\nFirst, be sure that the image is either one created by you or one that is freely licensed (see \"Can I copy text and other content to Wikivoyage from other sites?\" below).  Then go ahead and upload it to [[:Commons:Special:UploadWizard|Wikimedia Commons]], our central image repository. \\n\\nIf your image is a photo of a work of art or architecture, you \\'\\'may\\'\\' need to upload it locally under our [[Wikivoyage:Non-free content#Exemption Doctrine Policy|Exemption Doctrine]]. Check [[:Commons:Freedom of Panorama]] to see whether the laws of the country where the photo was taken allow derivative works of publicly displayed art or architecture. If the image cannot be uploaded to Commons because of Freedom of Panorama issues, upload it here (but otherwise never upload anything here!). If you have no idea what this means, feel free to ask [[Wikivoyage:Administrators#Current administrators|an administrator]].\\n\\n=== How will I be attributed? ===\\n\\nYou will only be attributed for your work if you register a user account. You will be attributed by your user name, which appears in article history and credits pages. For an example, take a look at the history of this page [http://en.wikivoyage.org/w/index.php?title=Wikivoyage:Copyleft&action=history]. Re-users will have to provide attribution as well\\u2014online re-users will usually link back to the article being re-used, while offline re-users will simply state the source. \\n\\nFor files you upload, you must provide the attribution information yourself in the upload summary. So, just indicate however you want to be attributed as you upload the file.\\n\\n===Can I copy text and other content to Wikivoyage from other sites?===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Usually No\\'\\'\\'. That is, unless you are the original author of the text, or the other website has been \\'\\'explicitly\\'\\' licensed as compatible with Creative Commons Attribution/Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0, or it is in the public domain.\\n\\nIf you are the original author of the text, note that on the article talk page, or else someone will likely remove it as a copyright violation.\\n\\nWikimedia projects like \\'\\'\\'Wikipedia\\'\\'\\' have a compatible license, so we \\'\\'can\\'\\' copy relevant text.  When copying text from another site with a compatible license, you must cite the article from which you are copying in the edit summary and include a link to the license terms.\\n\\nFor the content to be public domain, it needs to be created by the U.S. Federal Government, the city government of Washington, D.C., or have a statement on the website saying it is released into the public domain. That great picture you took of the [[RMS Titanic]] leaving port is likely also safe for anyone to use; copyright does eventually expire (depending on date and place of publication) and an author is free to release their own work to the public domain at any time.\\n\\nLack of a copyright notice does not mean the content is free to re-use\\u2014all online content is automatically copyrighted unless the author explicitly states otherwise.\\n\\n=== If content is available free-of-charge, can it be used here? ===\\n\\nProbably not. Just because a map, brochure, or other item is given away for free does not mean that it has been freely \\'\\'licensed\\'\\'. For content to be usable on Wikivoyage the content copyright owner \\'\\'\\'must\\'\\'\\' agree to license it under the CC-SA 3.0 or a compatible license.\\n\\n=== How should I ask for permission to use a copyrighted work on Wikivoyage? ===\\n\\nThe following template can help. Please quote your original message and reply to it at the respective article\\'s Talk page. You may provide attribution to the original author(s) listing them by a template like [[:Template:Attribution]].\\n:\\'\\'Hello (person name).\\n:\\'\\'<nowiki>Do you mind if I use some of your work at <work name> to contribute to an article on <destination> at Wikivoyage, a free online travel guide written and edited entirely by travelers from around the globe?</nowiki>\\'\\'\\n:\\'\\'<nowiki>The current version of the article I am going to update is here: <article permalink URL>.</nowiki>\\'\\'\\n:\\'\\'Wikivoyage requires all of its content to be licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license or another suitably compatible copyleft license.

       "  u'text': {u'#text': u'{{pagebanner|Szczecin Wikivoyage Banner.png}}\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'[http://www.szczecin.eu/en/ Szczecin]\\'\\'\\', (pronounced \\'\\'Shchetsin\\'\\', German: \\'\\'Stettin\\'\\', Latin: \\'\\'Stetinum\\'\\'; is maritime port city and the capital of [[Zachodniopomorskie]] in [[Poland]]. The city has a population of over 400 000 thousand, with almost 800 000 living its metro area, and is one of the seven largest metropoles in the country. It lies in the northwestern corner of Poland, very close to the German border, and it is in fact easier to get to Szczecin from some parts of Germany, notable from [[Berlin]], than it is from much of the Polish territory. For a significant part of its history, actually, Szczecin was a part of Germany, as well as, in other periods, of Denmark and Sweden.\\n\\nSzczecin is Poland\\'s third-largest port and much of its industrial base used to be a part of an important shipyard, so it may come as a surprise to the casual tourist that the city does not lay on a seaside, but rather over the river Odra (German: \\'\\'Oder\\'\\'), some 20&nbsp;kilometres south of the Baltic Sea as the crow flies, and many more by road. Many visitors to Poland are also unaware of Szczecin\\'s architectural attractiveness, as the large parts of the city were designed by Baron Haussmann, the same gentleman who designed the boulevards of [[Paris]]. \\n\\n==Understand==\\nThe place now known as Szczecin was first mentioned in written history in 1st century when West-Roman historian Tacitus located East Germanic tribe of Rugians somewhere in the area; the Rugians left in 5th Century during the Great Migration. Sometime in the 8th century Western Slavic tribe of Pomeranians built their stronghold here. In 10th century the town was mentioned as \"one of major in Pomerania\" in Abraham ben Jacob\\'s chronicle. In approximately 1080 its area was incorporated into [[Poland]], but within eight years, the town was controlled by the Dukedom of Pomerania, and five years later, [[Denmark]]. In 12th century when its competitor, [[Wolin]] (also known as Veneta in medieval chronicles) declined Szczecin began to prosper from trade and became one of the major Baltic sea harbours. Its name was first recorded in 1133 as \"Stetin\". \\n\\nIn 1181 Pomeranian dukes joined Holy Roman Empire. In 1243 Szczecin got city rights before it became member of the Hanseatic League in 1278. Until early 17th century the city was the capital of Pomeranian Dukedom, then in 1630 when local dukes died out it became part of [[Sweden]],  then Kingdom of Prussia, then for a brief period, due to Napoleon\\'s conquests, the Empire of [[France]]. Beginning in the 18th century, the city constituted as a part of [[Germany]] and served as the \"port of Berlin\". During World War II the city was hit hard by Allied bombers - city centre, Old Town and industrial areas were totally ruined. After the Soviet forces invaded Nazi Germany in 1945, according to Potsdam Conference agreements Poland annexed all lands up to the Oder river, expelling the native German population and ultimately extending the border to include Stettin. Poland thus gained control of the city.\\n\\nIn more recent history, the city was (together with [[Tricity]]) one of the birthplaces of Solidarity movement.\\n\\nAn unusual feature of Szczecin is its urban planning - many roundabouts and wide avenues. Stettin was rebuilt in 1880\\'s using designs by Georges-Eugene Haussmann, who also did the urban planning for [[Paris]]. His design style is still being used for newly-built (or modified) city areas.\\n\\nThe maritime industry is still strong with a busy port and repair shipyard, as well as being a center of service industries in Poland. Situated near the border between Germany and Poland, Szczecin is sometimes considered one of most liberal Polish cities.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n\\n===By plane===\\n\\nSzczecin-Goleni\\xf3w airport (SZZ) [http://www.airport.com.pl/en/show/start-page] is located almost 50&nbsp;km from the city centre, near Goleni\\xf3w. \\n* Ryanair operates daily flights between Szczecin and [[London]] (Stansted), and 2 flights per week to and from [[Dublin]] and [[Liverpool]].\\n* LOT has several flights daily between Szczecin and [[Warsaw]]. Note that cancellations do happen, so take that into account when planning onward travel. \\n* Eurolot [http://eurolot.com] has flights from Szczecin to [[Krak\\xf3w]] (both direct and via [[Pozna\\u0144]], 4 times a week) and to [[Rzesz\\xf3w]] (twice a week).\\n* Norwegian operates two flights per week between Szczecin and both [[Trondheim]] and [[Oslo]].\\nYou can reach the airport by car (the journey may take up to 1 hour, depending on traffic), by taxi (about 120 PLN), or by minibus - LOT operates a minibus to and from the airport for all LOT\\'s flights (free of charge for passengers), leaving from LOT\\'s office (al. Wyzwolenia 17) about 90 minutes before departure, and Interglobus has minibuses for all international flights. In July 2013, a railway service linking the airport\\'s terminal directly with Szczecin\\'s main railway station and with [[Ko\\u0142obrzeg]] was inaugurated.\\n\\nDue to Szczecin\\'s proximity to [[Berlin]], you may use the latter\\'s airports to get to Szczecin as well. From there, you can reach Szczecin by minibus (numerous Szczecin-based companies, including Atlastransfer - Berlinia.eu [http://berlinia.eu/en/]  and Interglobus [http://www.interglobus.pl/_Interglobus.aspx], operate regular services to Tegel and Schoenefeld airports at attractive prices), by car or by train in 2\\u20133 hours.\\n\\n===By train===\\n\\nPolish State Railways (PKP) [http://www.pkp.pl/] has connections to and from all major Polish cities. There are several trains daily to and from [[Warsaw]] - travel time on express or Intercity trains is less than 6 hours, but minor delays are not uncommon. To [[Pozna\\u0144]], travel time is about 2.5 hours (from PLN 40), with frequent trains running throughout the day. There are also frequent trains to [[\\u015awinouj\\u015bcie]] (2 hours).\\n\\nGerman Railways [http://www.bahn.de] has train connections from [[Berlin]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Prague]] and many cities in neighboring [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]].\\n\\nThe cheapest way to get to [[Berlin]] is by joining a group of up to 5 people riding on one Berlin-Brandenburg Ticket, which is valid from 9 am to 3 am the following day for travel on all local and regional German trains and on local public transport systems in all cities and towns, including Berlin and Szczecin. The ticket costs 28 euros, so one person can travel for ca. 5 euros. The groups often form spontaneously before departure or on the train itself. There is also the new Berlin-Stettin-Ticket for 10 Euros per person one way.\\n\\nBerlin-Stettin-Ticket, Brandenburg-Berlin-Ticket, Brandenburg-Berlin-Ticket Nacht, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern-Ticket, and Sch\\xf6nes-Wochenende-Ticket are valid for routes to and from the city of Szczecin and for the entire public transport system in Szczecin.\\n\\nYou even can get from or to the Danish border via Schleswig-Holstein-Ticket, valid in the regional trains of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein until Padborg or Tonder (DK) with a surcharge of \\u20ac2,50 for the ride from the Polish border to Szczecin.\\n\\n===By car===\\nYou can reach Szczecin by car from major Polish cities, including [[Warsaw]], [[Pozna\\u0144]], [[Gda\\u0144sk]], [[Wroc\\u0142aw]], and also from [[Berlin]]. Thanks to its location close to the border and direct link with the German motorway system, Szczecin has the best road connection with Western Europe of all Polish cities.\\n\\nThe main route to Szczecin from Berlin is the E28 (German: A11, Polish: A6). The journey takes about 2 hours, depending on traffic. Note that the German A11 motorway is undergoing continuous improvements, resulting in some disturbances in certain sections. \\n\\nTravelling by car to and from other parts of Poland can be troublesome - the traffic is pretty heavy, the distances are large and there is a general shortage of motorways. It also takes quite some time - for example, the trip to Gda\\u0144sk (350&nbsp;km) usually takes 4\\u20135 hours, and to Warsaw (520&nbsp;km along national road no. 10) you need at least 6\\u20137 hours, even if you don\\'t follow the speed limits too strictly. \\n\\nYou can also reach Szczecin from [[Sweden]] ([[Ystad]]) and [[Denmark]] ([[Copenhagen]]) using the ferry connections to and from [[\\u015awinouj\\u015bcie]]. From there, the journey takes about 1.5 hours, although this road gets completely jammed on summer weekends. To avoid traffic jams in high season, follow the yellow \"tourist route\" (\"Trasa turystyczna\") signs. These will take you along B-roads, bypassing the most crowded section of national road no.3.\\n\\n===By bus===\\n\\nMany international and domestic connections (see [[Poland#By bus|Poland::By bus]]).\\n* [http://www.pks.szczecin.pl/ PKS Szczecin] operates daily connection with [[Schwedt]] in [[Germany]]\\n* dozens of minibus operators driving to and from [[Berlin]]\\n\\n===By boat===\\nSzczecin is situated on the banks of the Oder (Polish: \\'\\'Odra\\'\\') and Regalica (branch of the Oder) rivers and Lake D\\u0105bie, near the Szczecin Lagoon. There is a number of marinas, most of them situated in the northern districts and on the shores of Lake Dabie.\\n\\nIn April 2008, hydrofoil service was re-established between Szczecin and \\u015awinouj\\u015bcie.  Bosman-Express [http://www.wodolot-szczecin.pl] hydrofoil runs twice a day from the Wa\\u0142y Chrobrego embankment, reaching \\u015awinouj\\u015bcie in about 75 minutes. Tickets are a bit overpriced at PLN 50/70 (economy/VIP class - but don\\'t expect any luxury), and there are discounts for children and groups. There is a snack-bar on board, beer is served. There is also a small viewing deck. Along the way you can see some quite interesting industrial sights in the northern part of Szczecin. \\n\\nDespite being a restored Soviet-made Meteor, now equipped with new engines, the hydrofoil is the quickest way to get to \\u015awinouj\\u015bcie - it moors at the left (western) bank of the \\u015awina, so the passengers avoid the need to use the ferry.\\n\\n==Get around==\\nSzczecin is split in two parts (Lewobrze\\u017ce and Prawobrze\\u017ce) named after their location on banks of Oder (Lewobrze\\u017ce = left bank) and Regalica (Prawobrze\\u017ce = right bank) rivers. The port is situated in between. City centre and most of attractions are situated in Lewobrze\\u017ce.\\n[[Image:SzczecinFacades.jpg|thumb|Fa\\xe7ades in new old town]]\\n\\n===Public transport===\\nSzczecin has extensive public transport network covered by trams and buses. See the maps [http://www.zditm.szczecin.pl/schematy.php] (\\'\\'dziennej\\'\\' = by day, \\'\\'nocnej\\'\\' = by night, \\'\\'tramwajowej\\'\\' = trams) and schedules [http://www.zditm.szczecin.pl/rozklady/]. You can also install the timetables on your mobile phone: for J2ME compatible phones and Symbian: MPK Mobile [http://www.mmpk.info/], Microbus [http://www.microbus.szczecin.pl/], for Android and Windows Phone: Transportoid [http://transportoid.com/].\\n\\n====Tickets====\\nTickets are randomly checked by plain clothed inspectors; fines are severe and can be a major hassle, so it\\'s better for you to buy them. They are available at all newspaper stands and you can buy them from the driver after 18:00. If you happen to have an account in Polish bank you can also use your mobile phone [http://www.mobilet.pl/home.htm]. Rush hours are 7:00-8:00 and 16:00-17:00, night hours are between 23:00 and 5:00. Tickets for express buses are twice expensive. You can change between lines freely as long you stay within time limit (the exception is changing from \"normal\" bus or tram to express bus). Prices:\\n\\n* 15 minutes: 2.00 z\\u0142\\n* 30 minutes: 3.00 z\\u0142\\n* 1 hour: 4.00 z\\u0142\\n* 2 hours: 5.00 z\\u0142\\n* 24 hours: 12 z\\u0142\\n* 5 days: 35 z\\u0142\\n* Family weekend ticket: 14 z\\u0142 - valid on weekends for one or two adults with at least one child up to 16 years old.\\n\\nThere are also tickets valid for 10 days, a month and a quarter.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Remember to stamp your ticket immediately after you board the tram/bus!\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nBrandenburg-Berlin, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Schleswig-Holstein, Sch\\xf6nes Wochenende and Brandenburg-Berlin Nacht tickets issued by Deutsche Bahn are valid for public transport operated by ZDiTM (trams and buses) in Szczecin. Monthly/quarterly tickets issued by ZDiTM are valid for DB trains within the city (Szczecin G\\u0142\\xf3wny-Szczecin Gumie\\u0144ce) [http://bip.um.szczecin.pl/files/3574D615E29E43F6A5E0E6FB0A7F6DCC/876-05.pdf].\\n\\n====Lines====\\n* 0 - tourist tram line\\n* 1-12 - trams\\n* 50, 100 - tourist bus lines\\n* 51-111 - buses\\n* A, B, C, D, E, F, G - express buses\\n* 521-534 - night buses\\n* 7xx - free buses (to and from shopping malls)\\n\\n====Tourist lines====\\n* Tourist lines (vintage trams and buses) operate in July and August on Saturdays and Sundays. The fare costs 3 z\\u0142 (paid to the driver). Line numbers: 0 (tram), 50 and 100 (buses).\\n\\n====Railway====\\nIf for any reason you want to go to or from the city centre (station name: Szczecin G\\u0142\\xf3wny) to districts of D\\u0105bie, Gumie\\u0144ce, Podjuchy, Zdroje, Zdunowo or Za\\u0142om (or nearby suburban towns of [[Goleni\\xf3w]], [[Gryfino]] or [[Stargard]]), the fastest way might be the train. Check times with  PKP [http://www.pkp.com.pl]; you have to buy separate ticket (6 z\\u0142, one way, no matter how many stops), the exception are trains operated by DB (see above).\\n\\n===By foot===\\nCity center can be covered by foot (depending on your fitness, etc.). Look for the red line on the pavements - so called \"red walk\" which connects nearly all the attractions within the centre. This is by far the best way to discover the centre on foot, as all attractions are marked by a number (there are about 40) on the pavement, so you won\\'t miss one. At each of them there is a sign explaining some details about the sight. \\nThe red line starts and ends at the train station. When you exit through the main entrance, turn left on the sidewalk and look for it, some of the paint may have already vanished. Close to the start is also a map showing the route and the attractions. You can get a similar map that also includes the red line at the tourist information center.\\n[[Image:SquareInNewOldSzczecin.jpg|thumb|Museum at new old town]]\\n\\n===By car===\\nStreets in Szczecin are (compared to other Polish cities) easy to navigate and not congested.\\n\\nHowever: parking within the centre during business hours (8:00 - 17:00, from Monday to Friday - after 17:00 and on weekends it is free) is paid; the pay depends on the zone and parking time. You can buy tickets from vending machines. Most of malls have free parking, and no one will check if you visited the mall or just used free parking opportunity.\\n\\nDUI is serious criminal offense (up to 3 years in prison) and the police have no mercy for drunk drivers - many of \"zero tolerance for drunk drivers\" programs ongoing in Poland have started in Szczecin.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Because of major renovation works in the city centre and Niebuszewo district held this year expect detours and/or traffic jams, especially during rush hours. If you stay in the city consider leaving your car on parking and using public transport.\\'\\'\\'\\n\\n===By bicycle===\\nThere is network of [[cycling|bicycle]] paths connecting the city center with the suburbs. You can take your bike on public transport for free (outside rush hours).\\nIf you want to see Szczecin from the bicycle but don\\'t have one you can rent it:\\n* Bicyklownia [http://www.bicyklownia.pl/], ul.

It is much cheaper to call for one - ask locals for numbers or see taxi advertisements, they are nearly everywhere. When you call, ask the operator when the taxi will arrive and then look for car plastered with number of company you called.\\n* There is taxi \"mafia\" operating from stands near railway station, popular clubs, hotels etc. - avoid these rip-offs, they are VERY expensive!\\n* Taxi fare within the centre shouldn\\'t cost you more than about 12-15 z\\u0142. Fare from left side of the river (Lewobrze\\u017ce) to the right side (Prawobrze\\u017ce) or the other way is about 40-50 z\\u0142. Fares during the night are slightly more expensive.\\n* All officially registered taxis have meters, the driver should turn them on just after you enter.\\n* Payment: have cash ready, only the minority of taxi drivers have necessary equipment for payments with debit or credit cards. Ask if in doubt.\\n\\nSome of taxi companies operating in the city:\\n* Auto Taxi: +48 91 4535555\\n* City Taxi: +48 91 4335335\\n* Express Taxi: +48 91 4261038\\n* Euro Taxi: +48 91 4343434\\n* Gold Taxi: +48 91 8122222\\n* Granada Taxi: +48 91 4554554\\n* Szczecin Taxi: +48 91 4835835\\n\\n==See==\\n[[Image:SzczecinCastle.jpg|thumb|Castle]]\\n[[File:PolandSzczecinPortGate.JPG|thumb|Harbour Gate (Brama Portowa)]]\\n* Pomeranian Dukes Castle [http://www.zamek.szczecin.pl/] (\\'\\'Zamek Ksi\\u0105\\u017c\\u0105t Pomorskich\\'\\'), which houses museum, restaurants and cafes.

Nowadays it is a very safe city. However, you should stay away from some of its \"bad\" suburbs, like Goc\\u0142aw, especially after dark. As always, use your common sense.\\nBe careful when crossing streets - jaywalking is a crime in Poland and the police often lie in wait for tourists crossing streets when the pedestrian crossing is on red.  If stopped, claim that your money and passport are in your hotel and you may get away with it.\\n\\n==Cope==\\n===Consulates===\\n* Cyprus, ul. \\u015al\\u0105ska 7, 091/4330766\\n* Czech Republic, ul.

In the north of the country on the river Seine, Paris has the reputation of being the most beautiful and romantic of all cities, brimming with historic associations and remaining vastly influential in the realms of culture, art, fashion, food and design.  Dubbed the \\'\\'\\'City of Light\\'\\'\\' (\\'\\'la Ville Lumiere\\'\\') and \\'\\'\\'Capital of Fashion\\'\\'\\', it is home to some of the world\\'s finest and most luxurious fashion designers and cosmetics, such as \\'\\'Chanel\\'\\', \\'\\'Christian Dior\\'\\', \\'\\'Yves Saint-Laurent\\'\\', \\'\\'Guerlain\\'\\', \\'\\'Lancome\\'\\', \\'\\'L\\'Oreal\\'\\', and \\'\\'Clarins\\'\\'. A large part of the city, including the River Seine, is a [[UNESCO World Heritage List|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

You might, for example, stay in the \"5th\", which would be written as \\'\\'5e\\'\\' in French. The 12th and 16th arrondissements include large suburban parks, the \\'\\'Bois de Vincennes\\'\\', and the \\'\\'Bois de Boulogne\\'\\' respectively.\\n\\nThe very best map you can get for Paris is called \"\\'\\'Paris Pratique par Arrondissement\\'\\'\" which you can buy for about 5 at any news stand.

Schematically, those on the  west of Paris ([[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], [[Saint Cloud (France)|Saint Cloud]], [[Levallois]]) are wealthy residential communities. Those to the northeast are poorer communities, much populated by immigrants.\\n\\n==Understand==\\n\\n===History===\\nParis started life as the Celto-Roman settlement of \\'\\'Lutetia\\'\\' on the Ile de la Cite, the island in the Seine currently occupied by the \\'\\'Cathedral de Notre Dame\\'\\'.  It takes its present name from the name of the dominant Gallo-Celtic tribe in the region, the \\'\\'Parisii\\'\\'. At least that\\'s what the Romans called them, when they showed up in 52 BCE and established their city \\'\\'Lutetia\\'\\' on the left bank of the Seine, in what is now called the \"Latin Quarter\" in the [[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th arrondissement]].\\n\\nThe Romans held out here for as long as anywhere else in the Western Empire, but by 508 CE they were gone, replaced by \\'\\'\\'Clovis of the Franks\\'\\'\\', who is considered by the French to have been their first king. Clovis\\' descendants, aka the Carolingians, held onto the expanded Lutetian state for nearly 500 years through Viking raids and other calamities, which finally resulted in a forced move by most of the population back to the islands which had been the centre of the original Celtic village.  The Capetian Duke of Paris was voted to succeed the last of the Carolingians as King of France, ensuring the city a premier position in the medieval world. Over the next several centuries Paris expanded onto the right bank into what was and is still called \\'\\'le Marais\\'\\' (The Marsh). Quite a few buildings from this time can be seen in the [[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th arrondissement]].\\n\\nThe medieval period also witnessed the founding of the Sorbonne. As the \"University of Paris\", it became one of the most important centres for learning in Europeif not the whole world, for several hundred years. Most of the institutions that still constitute the University are found in the [[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]], and [[Paris/13th arrondissement|13th arrondissements]].\\n\\nIn the late 18th century, there was a period of political and social upheaval in France and Europe, during which the French governmental structure, previously a monarchy with feudal privileges for the aristocracy and Catholic clergy, underwent radical change to forms based on Enlightenment principles of nationalism, citizenship, and inalienable rights. Notable events during and following the revolution were the storming of the Bastille [[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th arrondissements]], and the rise and fall of Napoleonic France. Out of the violent turmoil that was the French Revolution, sparked by the still known \\'\\'Passion des Francais\\'\\', emerged the enlightened modern day France.\\n\\nThe Paris of today was built long after the Capetian and later the Bourbon Kings of France made their mark on Paris with the \\'\\'Louvre\\'\\' and the \\'\\'Palais Royal\\'\\', both in the [[Paris/1st arrondissement|1st]]. In the 19th century, Baron von Hausmann set about reconstructing the city, by adding the long straight avenues and replacing many of the then existing medieval houses, with grander and more uniform buildings.\\n[[File:Tour Eiffel Wikimedia Commons.jpg|thumb|210px|The Eiffel Tower]]\\n\\nNew wonders arrived during \\'\\'La Belle Epoque\\'\\', as the Parisian golden age of the late 19th century is known. Gustave Eiffel\\'s famous tower, the first metro lines, most of the parks, and the streetlights (which are partly believed to have given the city its epithet \"the city of light\") all come from this period. Another source of the epithet comes from \\'\\'Ville Lumiere\\'\\', a reference not only to the revolutionary electrical lighting system implemented in the streets of Paris, but also to the prominence and aura of \\'\\'Enlightenment\\'\\' the city gained in that era.\\n\\nThe twentieth century was hard on Paris, but thankfully not as hard as it could have been. Hitler\\'s order to burn the city was thankfully ignored by the German General von Choltitz who was quite possibly convinced by a Swedish diplomat that it would be better to surrender and be remembered as the saviour of Paris, than to be remembered as its destroyer. Following the war, the city recovered quickly at first, but slowed in the 1970s and 1980s when Paris began to experience some of the problems faced by big cities everywhere: pollution, housing shortages, and occasionally failed experiments in urban renewal.\\n\\nDuring this time however, Paris enjoyed considerable growth as a multi-cultural city, with new immigrants from all corners of the world, especially \\'\\'La Francophonie\\'\\', including most of northern and western Africa as well as Vietnam and Laos. These immigrants brought their foods and music, both of which are of prime interest for many travellers.\\n\\nImmigration and multi-culturalism continues in the 21st century with a marked increase in the arrival of people from Latin America, especially [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], and [[Brazil]]. In the late 1990s, it was hard to find good Mexican food in Paris, whereas today there are dozens of possibilities from lowly \\'\\'taquerias\\'\\' in the outer \\'\\'arrondissements\\'\\' to nice sit-down restaurants on the boulevards. Meanwhile Latin music from salsa to samba is all the rage (well, alongside Paris lounge electronica).\\n\\nThe 21st century has also seen vast improvements in the general liveability of Paris, with the mayor\\'s office concentrating on reducing pollution and improving facilities for soft forms of transportation including a huge network of cycle paths, larger pedestrian districts and newer faster metro lines. Visitors who normally arrive car-less are the beneficiaries of these policies as much as the Parisians themselves are.\\n\\n===Climate===\\n{{Climate\\n| units = Metric\\n| janhigh =   7\\n| febhigh =   9\\n| marhigh =   12\\n| aprhigh =   16\\n| mayhigh =   20\\n| junhigh =   23\\n| julhigh =   25\\n| aughigh =   26\\n| sephigh =   23\\n| octhigh =   17\\n| novhigh =   11\\n| dechigh =   7\\n| janlow =   3\\n| feblow =   3\\n| marlow =   5\\n| aprlow =   8\\n| maylow =   11\\n| junlow =   14\\n| jullow =   16\\n| auglow =   17\\n| seplow =   14\\n| octlow =   9\\n| novlow =   6\\n| declow =   4\\n| janprecip = 54\\n| febprecip = 44\\n| marprecip = 49\\n| aprprecip = 53\\n| mayprecip = 65\\n| junprecip = 55\\n| julprecip = 63\\n| augprecip = 43\\n| sepprecip = 55\\n| octprecip = 60\\n| novprecip = 52\\n| decprecip = 59\\n}}\\n\\nIn Western Europe, Paris has a maritime climate with cool winters and warm summers. The moderating effect of the Atlantic Ocean helps to temper temperature extremes in much of western Europe, including France. Even in January, the coldest month, temperatures nearly always exceed the freezing point with an average high of 7C (45F). Snow is not common in Paris, although it will fall a few times a year, with major snowstorms occurring every few years. Most of Paris\\'s precipitation comes in the form of light rain year-round.\\n\\nSummers in Paris are warm and pleasant, with an average high of 26C (78F) in August, the warmest month. Spring and fall are normally cool and wet.\\n\\n==Get in==\\n\\n===By plane===\\nParis is served by two international airports - for more information, including arrival/departure times, check the official sites.\\n\\n====Charles de Gaulle International Airport (Roissy) ====\\n{{Main|Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport}}\\n\\nNorth of Paris, CDG is the main airport of the city. The airport is connected to the city by train, bus and taxi. The RER train line \"B\" connects CDG airport to central Paris. There are non-stop RER line B trains that travel directly from CDG to Paris\\'s Gare du Nord station, which then continue to several stops in central Paris. As of January 2015, the one-way trip costs 10 (Zone 5 to Zone 1).\\n\\n====Orly International Airport====\\n[http://www.aeroportsdeparis.fr/ADP/en-GB/Passagers/Access-maps-car-parks/Paris-Orly/Access/public-transport/ Orly] {{IATA|ORY}}, this older international airport is southwest of the city and is used mainly by Air France for domestic departures, and international departures by European carriers. It consists of two terminals: Terminal Sud (south) and Terminal Ouest (west) connected by light rail. The airport is connected with Paris by bus and rail.\\n\\nOrly is roughly 40 min from Paris via the \\'\\'\\'OrlyBus\\'\\'\\', which departs from Metro Denfert-Rochereau (line 6); the price is 7.70 (2015). There are buses every 10-15 minutes from the Orly Sud (Platform 4) and it stops at Orly Ouest on its way to the city. Tickets can be bought at a counter near the baggage claim area or directly at the counter in Platform 4. The tickets need to be validated once on the bus. Another option is tramway T7 that takes you to the Metro Villejuif - Louis Aragon (Metro 7) in 30 min, but it stops on the way and is designed for commuters and not for travellers. Tramway T7 costs a single T+ (metro/bus/tram) ticket (2 if bought on board the bus) and runs every 10 min, stopping at airport level -1. Passes covering zones 1-4 are accepted, excepted the day pass \"Mobilis\" on the Orlybus.\\n\\nVia rail the airport can be reached by a southern branch of the RER-B line that heads from Paris in the direction of Saint-Remy-les-Chevreuse (\\'\\'\\'not\\'\\'\\' Robinson). At \\'\\'Antony\\'\\' station RER-B line connects with the \\'\\'\\'Orlyval\\'\\'\\' light rail that carries passengers to both terminals of the airport. Orlyval runs every 4-7 min and costs 12.05 (2015) for transfer to Paris, including connections to central area metro stations. The RER B from Antony runs through Paris to Aeroport Charles de Gaulle. The airport can be also reached by RER-C trains heading from Paris to Massy or Pont de Rungis. From \\'\\'Pont de Rungis-Aeroport d\\'Orly\\'\\' station passengers get to the airport within 10 minutes by a shuttle bus. The travel from Paris downtown to the airport by RER-C and the shuttle costs 6.85 (2015).\\n\\n===== Connect =====\\n[http://www.aeroportsdeparis.fr/ADP/en-GB/Passagers/Onlineservices/WiFi/Default1.htm Wi-Fi Internet access] is provided free of charge.\\n\\n====Beauvais (Aeroport de Beauvais Tille)====\\n[http://www.aeroportbeauvais.com/index.php?lang=eng Beauvais] ({{IATA|BVA}}), a distance north of the city, is a smaller regional airport that is used by some low-cost carriers such as [http://flightmapper.net/airports/BVA.html Ryanair] and WizzAir. Like many small airports there is a cartel in operation in the form of the airport operated shuttle service connecting with the \\'\\'Metro\\'\\' at \\'\\'Porte Maillot\\'\\' station. Buses run even during the small hours of the morning (06:00). Buses leave 20 min after each flight arrives, and a few hours before each flight departs. Exact times can be found on the [http://www.aeroportbeauvais.com/horaire_bus.php?lang=eng Beauvais Airport website]. The journey will take about an hour in good traffic conditions, and costs 16 each way, there is no reduced price for children over the age of 2 years.  Unless you hire a car this is the most realistic way to head toward Paris, hence why the airport charge the price they do.  The alternative is a train service between Gare du Nord and Beauvais, and a connecting shuttle or taxi to the airport.  This journey costs more and takes longer.  Missing the shuttle bus could mean a taxi fare well over 100.\\n\\n====Airline Shuttles====\\nIn addition to public transport, Air France operates shuttles between Charles de Gaulle and Paris (17), Orly and Paris (12) and between the two airports (20). Discounts apply for young/group travellers and online bookers. Note that if you have connecting Air France flights that land and depart from different airports, you would still generally need to fetch your luggage after landing, catch either the Air France shuttle or a taxi (readily available at all airports) to the other airport and check-in again. This altogether could take up to 2 hours, particularly if traffic is at its worst. It is also common to lose time during disembarking, as passengers often need to get off on the tarmac and get on buses which will take them to the terminal. Be sure you have sufficient time between flights to catch your connection. Check-in counters usually close 30 min before the flight departs, longer if flights are international.\\n\\nIf you want to take RER B to catch an early flight, make sure you \\'\\'\\'bring enough change\\'\\'\\', because you can only buy tickets at the coins-only machines before the counter opens.\\n\\nIf you arrive to CDG Airport at night you\\'ll need a Noctilien bus to get to the city centre. The bus stops at all three terminals (in terminal 2F it will be the second level in the departure section, difficult to find, but it really exists). The bus leaves every 30 min after 12:30 (see \\'\\'timetable\\'\\' [http://www.ratp.info/horaires/index.php?etape=choix_noct]). The buses you\\'ll need are N140 and N143; the price is 4 T+ tickets (8 if bought on board).\\n\\n===By train===\\n\\n[[Image:Paris europe train map.png|thumb|right]]\\n\\nParis is well connected to the rest of Europe by train. There is \\'\\'\\'no central station\\'\\'\\' serving Paris and the six different stations are not connected to each other.

There are also a few local lines of high touristic interest which are privately owned. All SNCF, Eurostar and Thalys tickets can be bought in railway stations, city offices and travel agencies (no surcharge). SNCF relies on travel agencies for selling tickets online, the main one being [http://www.voyages-sncf.com/ Voyages SNCF] (you will need the card with chips only used to pay the tickets to retrieve the actual tickets in any SNCF station, some foreign cards won\\'t be accepted) and [http://www.capitainetrain.com Capitaine Train] (easier to use, and you can retrieve your ticket at any counter or machine with just your name and booking reference). You can also find tickets in online and physical travel agencies. You can book and buy tickets up to three months in advance. There are significant discounts if you book weeks ahead. Reduced ticket prices are different for each day and each train and can be used only on the train the reservation is for. Surprisingly, round trip tickets (\\'\\'aller-retour\\'\\') with a stay over Saturday night can be cheaper than a single one-way ticket (\\'\\'aller simple\\'\\').\\n\\nTrains between Paris and south Germany (Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Munich) as well as the Marseille-Frankfurt TGV are jointly operated by SNCF and Deutsche Bahn, but each of the two operators will sell tickets at its own price! Make sure to check the price offered by each operator before you buy, or use Capitaine Train since they automatically compare SNCF and DB prices.\\n\\nThere are a number of different kinds of high-speed and normal trains:\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'TER\\'\\'\\': The regional trains (\\'\\'Train Express Regional\\'\\'); cheapest tickets, though prices are variable on the time of day of departure (and the day of departure as well). TER are sometimes slower, stopping at almost all stations. TER tickets bought at the train station are valid two months from the date indicated on the ticket, as long as you travel in the right fare period (\"periode bleue\", the cheapest, \"periode blanche\", for high-demand hours). There is no seat reservation, so arrive early enough or you may have to travel without a seat.\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'Intercites\\'\\'\\': A bundling of the former \\'\\'Intercites\\'\\', \\'\\'Teoz\\'\\', and \\'\\'Lunea\\'\\' train categories. There are two kinds: the regular trains, which are priced the same as the TER and the trains you\\'ll find yourself on if you have a [[Eurail]] or [[InterRail]] pass and don\\'t want to pay extra for reservations, and the \\'\\'trains a reservation obligatoire\\'\\', which require a reservation and are priced differently from the regular \\'\\'Intercites\\'\\' trains.\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'TGV\\'\\'\\': The world-famous French high-speed trains (\\'\\'Trains a Grande Vitesse\\'\\') run very frequently to the southeast [[Nice]](5-6 hr), Marseille (3 hr) and [[Avignon]] (2.5 hr), the east [[Geneva]] (3hr) or [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Dijon]] (1 hr 15 min), the southwest [[Bordeaux]] (3 hr), the west [[Rennes]] (2 hr) and the north [[Lille]] (1 hr).

Not surprisingly, traffic jams are significantly worse during French school holidays.\\n\\nThe multi-lane highway around Paris, called the \\'\\'Peripherique\\'\\' (BP), is probably preferable to driving through the center. Another beltway nearing completion; \\'\\'L\\'A86\\'\\' (also A186 and A286) loops around Paris about 10&nbsp;km further out from the \\'\\'Peripherique\\'\\'. A third, incomplete beltway is much further out and called \\'\\'La Francilienne\\'\\' (N104).\\n\\nIt is advised not to drive in the Paris Metro Area. It is better to drive to a suburban train station with a parking lot and then use the train to continue your trip throughout Paris. Most of Paris\\' roads were created long before the invention of automobiles. Traffic inside the city tends to be heavy, especially at rush hour; driving, however, may be rather easy and efficient in the evening.  Parking is also difficult. Furthermore, the medieval nature of parts of the city\\'s street system makes it very confusing, and traffic will almost never allow one to stop or slow down to get one\\'s bearings. If you are unfamiliar with the streets and still insist on driving in the city, make sure you have a navigator in the passenger seat with you.\\n\\n==Get around==\\n\\nThe best and cheapest way to get around Paris is on foot, and secondly, using the Metro which is around 1.70 for a one way trip of any length.\\n\\n===On foot===\\n\\n{{Infobox|Paris walking 101|To get a great orientation of the city on foot while seeing many of Paris\\' major sights, you can do a West to East walk from the Arc de Triomphe to Ile de la Cite (Notre Dame). This walk takes about 1-2 hours without any stops. Start at the top of the Champs Elysees (at the Arc de Triomphe) and begin walking down the Champs Elysees towards Place (\\'square\\') de la Concorde.  \\n*On the way towards the obelisk on the square, you\\'ll see the major stores and restaurants of Paris\\' most famous avenue.  \\n*Once you\\'ve passed the main shopping area, you\\'ll see the Petit Palais and the Grand Palais to your right.  \\n*At Place de la Concorde, you\\'ll be able to see many of Paris\\' major monuments around you.  In front of you is the Tuileries, behind you is the Champs-Elysees and Arc de Triomphe, behind you to your right is the Tour Eiffel and Musee d\\'Orsay, and finally, to your left is the Madeleine.  \\n*Continue straight ahead and enter the Tuileries Gardens passing by fountains, flowers, and lovers in the park.  \\n*As you continue straight ahead, and out of the garden, you\\'ll see the pyramid entrance to the Louvre directly in front of you.  \\n*With the pyramid directly in front of you, and the Tuileries directly behind you, turn to your right and walk towards the Seine.  \\n*Now you can walk along the Seine (eastwards) until you reach Pont Neuf.  Cross Pont Neuf and walk through the Latin Quarter, cross the river again to reach Notre Dame cathedral on Ile de la Cite.}}\\n\\nWalking in Paris is one of the great pleasures of visiting the City of Light. It is possible to cross the entire city in only a few hours, but only if you can somehow keep yourself from stopping at numerous cafes and shops. In fact within a few years walking combined with biking and the \\'\\'Metro\\'\\' may be the only way to get around the very centre of Paris as plans develop to reduce access to cars in the city centre.\\n\\nThe smartest travellers take advantage of the walk-ability of this city, and stay above ground as much as possible. A metro ride of less than 2 stops is probably best avoided since walking will take about the same amount of time and you\\'ll be able to see more of the city.  That said, pay attention to the Metro stations that you may pass by on your journey; the Metro network is very dense within the city and the lines are virtually always located directly underneath major boulevards, so if you become lost it is easy to regain your bearings by walking along a major boulevard until you find a Metro station.\\n\\nYou may have heard of the hazard of walking into dog droppings in Paris.  The problem is now virtually nonexistent due to fines as high as 180 and an extensive street cleaning operations.\\n\\nIt\\'s always fun to experience the city by foot, and there are numerous walking tours around Paris, whether self-guided (with the help of a guidebook or online guide) or with a touring guide (booked through your travel agency or hotel). The city is best explored by foot, and some of the most marvelous memories you will have of Paris is walking through secret found places.\\n\\n===By Metro===\\nParis has an excellent underground train system, known as the \\'\\'Metro\\'\\' (short for \\'\\'Chemin de fer metropolitain\\'\\', Metropolitan Railway).  Although you will probably take the RER subway train from the airport to Paris, don\\'t be confused: [[w:RER|RER]] is a French-language acronym that translates to \"Regional Express Network,\" and is mostly used by commuters.  Look for the Metro stations, marked with a large \"M\" sign.\\n\\n[[File:Carte Metro de Paris.jpg|thumb|250px|Schematic plan of the Metro, Dec. 2012]]\\n==== Using the metro and the suburban train ====\\nThere are 16 Metro lines (\\'\\'lignes\\'\\') (\\'\\'1\\'\\'-\\'\\'14\\'\\', \\'\\'3bis\\'\\', and \\'\\'7bis\\'\\') on which trains travel all day at intervals of a few minutes. The service starts on each end of every line at 05:30, and the last metro arrives on each end at 01:15 (service ends an hour later on Friday and Saturday nights, and the day before a holiday), stopping at all stations on the line. Times for trains can be seen on an electronic scroll board above the platform. [[w:Paris Metro Line 14|Line 14]], which is fully automated, is called the \\'\\'Meteor\\'\\'. Scheduled times for first and last trains are posted in each station on the centre sign. Generally, except for early and late hours, travellers should not worry about specific Metro train times; just get to your station and take the next train.  Trains usually come 23 minutes apart during rush hour and 510 minutes apart during other times, depending on the line.\\n\\nVisitors travelling to or from the airport/train stations with heavy luggage need to keep in mind that changing metro lines might be difficult at times, especially at major metro intersections. Moving from one platform to another generally involves walking up and down multiple flights of stairs. Very few stations have elevators (only the newest line 14 is wheelchair-accessible at all stations, except when the elevators are out of order). Only the busiest ones have escalators. It might be a good idea to check out the Bus routes and timings and see if one can find a convenient bus connection.\\n\\nAll metro trains stop at all stations on their route. On most lines, all trains run end-to-end. Some lines have rare trains that terminate at an intermediate station; if that happens, get off the train with the rest of the crowd and board the next train on the same track or on the other side of the platform (the driver will usually make an announcement in French). Lines 7 and 13 have a fork, so if you take line 13 north of \\'\\'La Fourche\\'\\' or line 7 south of \\'\\'Maison Blanche\\'\\', make sure to board the train for the correct destination which is indicated by a lit arrow on the sign in the middle of the platform and on colour-coded binders in each carriage.\\n\\nThe lines are named according to the names of their terminal stations (the end of the line). If you ask the locals about directions, they will answer something like : take line number \\'\\'n\\'\\' towards \"end station 1\", change at \"station\", take the line \\'\\'nn\\'\\' towards \"end station 2\" etc. The lines are also colour-coded.\\n\\nIn addition, there are five commuter train lines: [[w:RER A|RER A]], [[w:RER B|RER B]], [[w:RER C|C]], [[w:RER D|D]], and [[w:RER E|E]].  RER trains run at intervals varying from about 3 minutes (RER A) to 6 minutes (RER D), and stop at every station \\'\\'\\'within\\'\\'\\' Paris. \\n \\n[[File:SIEL - RER B - Prochains trains.JPG|thumb|Next trains on RER B]]\\nThe Metro and RER move staggering numbers of people into, out of, and around Paris (6.75 million people per day on average), and most of the time in reasonable comfort.  Certain lines, however, are operating at or near capacity, sometimes being so full that you\\'ll have to let one or two trains pass before being able to board.  If you can help it, avoid Metro lines 1, 4, and 13 and RER line A and B during rush hours as these are the most congested lines in the system.\\n\\nIn addition to RER, there are many suburban train lines (Transilien) departing from the main train stations. One line of interest is the one from Gare Montparnasse to Versailles-Chantiers, a quick way to go to Versailles castle (covered by a ticket for at least Zones 1-4). The alternative is to use RER C to Versailles Rive Gauche (this station is the closest to the castle). Do \\'\\'not\\'\\' use RER C8 to Versailles Chantiers; this will do a very long loop in the southern suburbs before reaching Versailles.\\n\\nFor travel outside of the Paris zone, the train arrival times are shown on a monitor hanging from the ceiling inside the RER station above the platform.  Information about the stops to be made by the next incoming train is presented on a separate board also hanging from the ceiling. It is important to check this board before boarding the train, as not all trains make stops at all stations on a given line. Four letter codes (KRIN, DIPA, TORE, etc.) are used for the RER and Transilien trains; the first letter indicates the station where the train terminates, and the other three indicate the route and stops. Each line has its own nomenclature; on the RER A and B the letter codes are intended for the RATP or the SNCF staff (the two lines\\' operators) and the long-term commuters. On the other lines, they are intended for all passengers.\\n\\n[[File:RER A - Gare Noisiel.JPG|thumb|Information on service OKRE (Last stop Torcy)]]\\nYou can look up what these codes mean on information panels in the station, but the easiest and fastest way is often to check the information screens along the platforms.\\n\\n[[w:RATP|RATP]] [http://www.ratp.fr/en/ratp/c_5000/accueil/ (website)] is responsible for most public transport including metro, buses, and about half of the RER A and B. The rest of the RER, as well as Transilien, is operated by [[w:SNCF|SNCF]]. However, both companies take the same tickets, so the difference is of little interest for most people except in case of strikes (RATP may strike without SNCF doing so or the other way round). Current fares can be found at their website. Basically, as you move farther from Paris (into higher zones), tickets get more expensive.\\n\\n==== Fares ====\\n\\n[[File:Ticket T+.jpg|thumb|A \\'\\'ticket t\\'\\' allows you to use Paris metro network, as well as bus and tramway lines. RER access is authorized within Paris city only.]]\\n\\nAlthough a regular subway ticket can be used within Paris (Zone 1), it is necessary to pass the ticket through the turnstile when passing between the subway and the RER lines, as the two systems are separate networks. This ticket is necessary to \\'\\'enter\\'\\' and \\'\\'exit\\'\\' the RER networks, as the RER trains travel on to the Parisian suburbs, outside the zone where a regular subway ticket can be used. Beware that traveling outside the city centre without a valid RER ticket will get you fined, and the packs of inspectors who roam the system show no mercy to tourists pleading ignorance. In particular, the airports and the [[Versailles]] Palace are \\'\\'not\\'\\' within the city, and you\\'ll need to purchase a more expensive RER ticket to get there (see [[#Get in|Get in]]).\\n\\nFor the subway, a single ticket (\\'\\'ticket t+\\'\\') costs 1.80 (2015); however, it is generally not advisable to buy tickets by the unit. Instead, a \\'\\'carnet\\'\\' of ten tickets can be bought for {{multibuy_discount||13.70|10|1.8}} at any station. Tickets named \\'\\'tarif reduit\\'\\' may be purchased for children under the age of 10 but only in a carnet of 10 for 6.85. \\'\\'RER + Metro\\'\\' and \\'\\'Bus + Tram\\'\\' are two separate systems, but they use the same tickets. This means you have to use a new ticket if you transfer from bus to metro or from metro to bus. Tickets do not expire, but note that they are magnetic and thus should be kept away from some metallic objects such as coins.\\n\\nIf you use the metro, your ticket is valid for up to 2 hours for unlimited transfers in the whole metro network and in the RER within Paris. If you transfer from the RER to the metro, make sure to go through the transfer gates and not through the exit gates, otherwise your ticket will be lost. There are two exceptions: to transfer between RER C and the metro at Javel (with metro line 10) and at Musee d\\'Orsay (with metro line 12 at Solferino), you need to exit and cross the street but you can reuse the same ticket.\\n\\nIf you use the bus or tram, the ticket is valid for unlimited bus or tram transfers for up to 90 minutes from the first validation to the last validation (you need to validate your ticket each time you step into a new vehicle). It is not allowed to use the same ticket on the same line twice (for a round trip or a second leg).\\n\\nA one-day ticket, a weekly pass, and a monthly pass are also available.  The price varies according to the zones for which the ticket can be used. The cheapest 1-day ticket called \\'\\'[http://www.transilien.com/web/site/accueil/guide-du-voyageur/billets-tarifs/billets-abonnements/Mobilis/lang/en Mobilis]\\'\\', is valid for zones 1-2, with a price of 6.40. Once bought, it is necessary to write in the spaces provided on the ticket the date the ticket is being used \\'\\'\\'in European notation of day/month/year\\'\\'\\' (\\'\\'valable le\\'\\'), the last name (\\'\\'nom\\'\\'), and the first name (\\'\\'prenom\\'\\'). Unfortunately, this ticket is not valid for use for travel to/from Charles de Gaulle airport. Unless you plan to make many trips in one day, the \\'\\'carnet\\'\\' of ten tickets will still be a much better cost than a one-day ticket. However, consider the price for all members of your group/family, including children, which days you are traveling on, and in which zones you will be traveling.\\n\\nFor travelers under the age of 26, there is a special ticket (\\'\\'Jeunes Week-end\\'\\') that you can purchase for use on the weekends or holidays. The price varies depending on the zones you wish to cover (Zones 1-3 is 3.85 and Zones 1-5 is 8.35; there are other zone combinations available too) and the ticket is good for one day of unlimited usage of the metro, RER, bus, and trams. The date and your name must be written on the ticket as for the Mobilis ticket described above.\\n\\nIf you are staying a bit longer, the weekly and monthly passes are called \\'\\'[http://www.ratp.fr/fr/ratp/c_21137/forfaits-navigo-mois-et-semaine Navigo Decouverte]\\'\\' (1 week pass, 20.40 for zones 1-2) and the monthly \\'\\'Navigo Mensuel\\'\\' (one-month pass, 67.10 for zones 1-2). Note that an \\'\\'Decouverte\\'\\' (\\'\\'DAY-koo-VERT\\'\\') starts on Mondays and a \\'\\'Mensuel\\'\\' on the first of the month. The Navigo pass is non-transferrable and requires the user to provide information on the pass after the sale. The pass is sold for 5. You must write your last name (\\'\\'nom\\'\\') and your first name (\\'\\'prenom\\'\\') and stick your photo on the nominative card. After, you have to refill your pass with a \\'\\'recharge hebdomadaire\\'\\' (one-week refill), or a  \\'\\'recharge mensuelle\\'\\' (one-month refill). You have to choose at least two of the contiguous \"zones\": Paris is the first zone (as well as all metro stations outside Paris), La Defense is in the third zone (except on the metro, which is always zone 1), and Versailles in the fourth. Everything related to a \"Navigo\" pass is in purple (like the target for the pass in the turnstiles). Starting in September 2012, weekend travel is free throughout the entire Ile-de-France region for passengers holding a monthly or yearly Navigo pass, despite which zones are covered during the week. (For instance a Zone 1-2 pass would be valid for travel within Zones 1-5 on the weekends.)\\n\\nThe RATP sells passes dedicated to tourists called \\'\\'[http://www.ratp.fr/fr/ratp/r_94834/paris-visite/ Paris Visite]\\'\\', but much more expensive than the one they offer to locals. These passes do include something more (a map, and some tiny discounts on selected museums) but it is clearly not worth it. Instead of the \"Paris Visite 1 day\" or \"Paris Visite 3 days\", select the Mobilis passes for 1 or 3 days. The \"Paris Visite 5 days\" has no equivalent, but is still more expensive than the weekly pass for locals. Although not as good a deal for adults in most cases as the \\'\\'Mobilis\\'\\' or \\'\\'Navigo\\'\\', the Paris Visite passes might still be a bargain for kids of ages 411, starting at 6.10 per day for travel within zones 1-3.\\n\\nKeep your ticket or pass with you at all times as you may be checked. You will be cited and forced to pay on the spot if you do not have a ticket. The most likely spots for being checked are just behind the turnstiles at big metro stations or during metro line changes (\\'\\'correspondances\\'\\'). RATP agents may be present in the metro stations even on Sunday nights.\\n\\nMetro stations have both ticket windows and automatic vending machines. The majority of automatic vending machines do not take notes, only coins or European credit cards with a pin-encoded chip on the front. Therefore, to use either euro bills or a non-European credit card with a magnetic stripe, it is necessary to make the purchase from the ticket window. Be advised that some ticket vending machines do not give change, so use exact change or go to the ticket window. If you look at the vending machines closely, you may find one in the group that takes euro bills and will give change; these machines can be found at major or touristy stations such as Tuileries, Gare de Lyon or La Defense-Grande Arche.\\n\\n==== Access ====\\nSome larger stations have secondary entrances, where there is no ticket booth. These are labelled \\'\\'voyageurs munis de billets\\'\\' (passengers with tickets).\\n\\nWhen entering the turnstile with a ticket or Navigo pass, it will only work once for that particular station and can only be reset if you use it at another station.  Once you have passed your ticket or card, promptly move through the turnstile as it will not let you through if you attempt to use it again.\\n\\n{{Infobox|Avoid suburban charges|If you have any tickets or \\'\\'Navigo\\'\\' passes for zone 1-2 (\\'\\'inside\\'\\' the Paris area, the lower rate), they allow you to use any metro station, regardless of its actual zone. For example if you want go to La Defense (zone 3) from Chatelet, you have to take the Metro (Line 1). You can take the RER A (and save a few minutes), but you have to pay an additional fare because of the zone system for RER.}}\\n\\nEach station displays a detailed map of the surrounding area with a street list and the location of buildings (monuments, schools, places of worship, etc.,) as well as exits for that particular metro. Maps are located on the platform if the station has several exits or near the exit if there is only one exit.\\n\\nExcept for Metro 1, 2, 4, 5 and 14, the doors will not open automatically. In such a case, there are handles or buttons located both inside and outside the train that you have to push or unlatch in order to open the door. Many locals may try to squeeze into the trains after the alarm has sounded to signal the closing of the doors. While one can occasionally pass through on lines with a driver, the automatic doors on Metro 1 and 14 will continue to close despite the presence of a limb or article of clothing.  It is strongly advised to wait for the second train than to chance being caught between the doors.\\n\\nStrikes are a regular occurrence on the Paris public transit system. Generally during a strike, there will be reduced or no service on certain lines but parts of the network will continue to operate; however, in some cases the entire network may shut down completely. Visit the RATP and SNCF websites for information on which routes are affected by a strike. Generally, Metro lines 1 and 14 will be running during a strike because they are operated without human drivers - if you are caught by a strike, it is best to use it whenever possible.\\n\\n===By bus===\\n\\nSince the Metro is primarily structured around a hub-and-spoke model, there are some journeys for which it can be quite inefficient, and in these cases, it is worth seeing if a direct bus route exists, despite the complexity of the bus network. A bus ride is also interesting if you want to see more of the city. The Parisian bus system is quite tourist-friendly. It uses the same single-ride tickets and \\'\\'Navigo\\'\\' as the Metro, and electronic displays inside each bus tell riders its current position and what stops remain, eliminating a lot of confusion.\\n\\nThese same payment devices are also valid in the \\'\\'Noctilien\\'\\', the night bus. Night buses run regularly through the central hub at Chatelet to outlying areas of greater Paris. There is also a circle line connecting the main train stations. It pays to know one\\'s \\'\\'Noctilien\\'\\' route ahead of time in case one misses the last Metro home.  Women travellers should probably avoid taking the Noctilien on their own to destinations outside Paris.\\n\\nAnother option for travelers who want to see the sights of Paris without a stop on every street corner is the \\'\\'\\'Paris L\\'Opentour Bus\\'\\'\\', an open-topped double decker bus that supplies headsets with the most up to date information on the attractions in Paris. Your ticket is good for four routes ranging in time from 1-2 h.  Get off when you want, stay as long as you need, get back on the bus and head for another site.   You can purchase tickets at the bus stop.  A one-day pass is 25 for adults and 15 for children. A two-day pass is 32 for adults or 15 for children.\\n\\n===By boat===\\n[[File:Bateaux Mouches Paris 2011.jpg|thumb|A bateau mouche near the Pont Neuf]]\\nThere are several excellent boat services which make use of the Seine. As well as providing easy, cheap transport to much of central Paris, excellent photo opportunities abound. You can buy a day or 3 day ticket and hop on and off the boat as needed. The boats take a circular route from the Eiffel Tower, down past the Louvre, Notre Dame, botanical gardens then back up the other bank past Musee d\\'Orsay.  [http://www.batobus.com/ Batobus] offers a regular shuttle service between the main touristic sights (closed Jan); other companies such as the famous [http://www.bateaux-mouches.fr Bateaux Mouches] offer sightseeing cruises.\\n\\n===By bicycle===\\n{{Infobox|Directions|If you find yourself lost in the streets, a good idea is to find the nearest Hotel and ask the concierge for directions.  Most speak English well.  A simple \"\\'\\'Bonjour Monsieur, parlez-vous anglais?\\'\\'\" should suffice.}}\\n\\nRenting a bike is a very good alternative over driving or using public transport and an excellent way to see the sights. Riding a bike anywhere in the city is far safer for the moderately experienced cyclists than almost any town or city in the United States. The French are very cognizant of cyclists, almost to a point of reverence. A few years ago Paris wasn\\'t the easiest place to get around by bike but that has changed dramatically in recent years.  The city government has taken a number of steps in strong support of improving the safety and efficiency of the urban cyclist as well, in establishing some separated bike lanes, but even more important a policy of allowing cyclists to share the ample bus lanes on most major boulevards. Paris also has many riversides which are perfect for cycling.  The Paris bike network now counts over 150&nbsp;km of either unique or shared lanes for the cyclist.  In addition, the narrower, medieval side streets of the central arrondissements make for rather scenic and leisurely cycling, especially during off-hours of the day when traffic is lighter.  Do remember to bring a good map, since there is no grid plan to speak of and almost all of the smaller streets are one-way.\\n\\nNote that, while the streets of Paris are generally fairly easy on novice cyclists, there are some streets in the city that should be avoided by those who do not have sufficient urban cycling experience. Rue de Rivoli, Place de la Bastille, and Place de la Nation are particularly hairy, especially during weekdays and the Saturday evening rush, and should not be navigated by anyone not confident in their ability to cycle in heavy traffic. Avenue des Champs-Elysees, Place de l\\'Etoile, and voie Georges Pompidou (the lower-level express lanes along the banks of the Seine) should be avoided at all times.\\n\\nYou can find an excellent map of the bike network called [http://www.paris.fr/portail/viewmultimediadocument?multimediadocument-id=18436 \\'\\'Plan des Itineraires cyclables\\'\\']) at the information centre in the \\'\\'Hotel de Ville\\'\\'.\\n\\n*{{listing\\n| name=Velib | url=http://en.velib.paris.fr/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 30 79 79 30 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=1.70 per day\\n| content=In July 2007 the municipality of Paris introduced the \\'\\'\\'Velib\\'\\'\\' program (\\'\\'velo Liberte\\'\\' or Freedom Bikes) by which it is possible to rent a bike for a very modest price. Numerous stations are to be found around the city (at major landmarks and metro stations, basically every 300 m). With a credit card with a \"puce\" smart-chip (that means that American Visa and MasterCard cards do not work, however American Express cards should work even though they don\\'t have a chip), you can subscribe for 1 day (1.70) or 7 days (8) with a security deposit of 150 and then get a bike. The first 30 min are free, the following 30 min costs 1, following 30 min cost 2, etc., to avoid long rentals. Thus the game is to get to another station in 25 min and get another bicycle. This rental system has been designed to allow you to \"pick & drop\" a bike, not rent the same one all day long. Try it! If your card works in the machines it\\'s a great way to get around! The bicycles are wonderful cruiser bikes, with a front basket to put a purse or bag. If the saddle is turned around, it most probably means the bike is out of order (it\\'s a convention among Velib users, so do the same if you notice your Velib has problems). Be aware that if you use a non-French credit card, a deposit of 150 will be charged from your card, and refunded a few days later.}}\\n\\n===By scooter or motorbike===\\nParis is an incredibly open city, with its many \"grande boulevards\" and monuments with large open spaces around it makes for a city perfect to be explored and viewed from on a scooter. A lot of people think it is a dangerous city to drive a scooter or motorbike, and when you\\'re sitting in a corner cafe watching it may look that way, but in reality it is actually quite a safe city because the drivers are very conscious of one another, a trait that drivers certainly do not have in most other countries of the world! There are so many scooters in Paris, and there has been scooters in Europe forever really, so when people learn to drive here they learn to drive among the scooters. The French do drive quite fast, but they respect one another and it is rare that a driver will suddenly changes lanes or swing to the other side of the road without signalling. When you\\'re driving a scooter or motorbike in Paris you can expect to be able to \"lane-split\" between the rows of cars waiting in traffic and go straight to the front of the lights. Parking-wise there is plenty of \\'deux roues\\' (two wheel) parking all over the city. Do be careful of parking on the sidewalk though, especially on shopping streets or around monuments.\\n\\n*{{do\\n| name=Paris By Scooter | url=http://parisbyscooter.com/ | email=paris@parisbyscooter.com\\n| address=(Scooter always delivered to your hotel) | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 6 28 35 39 30 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=08:00-21:00 | price=From 60\\n| content=All Vespa scooter rentals and Paris guided City tours include the collect and picked up from, your hotel in Paris.\\n}}\\n\\n*{{listing\\n| name=Left Bank Scooters | url=http://www.leftbankscooters.com | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=Scooter delivered to your hotel\\n| phone=+33 6 78 12 04 24 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=08:00-20:00 | price=From 60\\n| content=Scooter rental that is delivered to, and picked up from, your hotel in Paris.

This is due to the large, smooth surfaces offered by both the pavements and the roads. Skating on the pavement is legal all around Central Paris (zone 1) and its suburbs (zones 2+).\\n\\n===By car===\\n\\nIn a word: \\'\\'\\'don\\'t\\'\\'\\'.  It is generally a very bad idea to rent a car to visit Paris. Traffic is very dense during the day, and parking is, on average, exceedingly difficult and expensive. This is especially true in areas surrounding points of touristic interest, since many of these are in areas designed long before automobiles existed. A majority of Parisian households do not own cars, and many people who move to the city find themselves selling their cars within a month or two.\\n\\nThat said, driving may be an option for going to some sights in the suburbs such as [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] castle or the castle and city at [[Fontainebleau]], or for starting to other places in France. You may prefer to rent from a location outside Paris proper.\\n\\nTraffic rules in Paris are basically the same as elsewhere in France, with the exception of having to yield to incoming traffic on roundabouts. However, driving in dense traffic in Paris and suburbs during commute times, can be especially strenuous. Be prepared for traffic jams, cars changing lanes at short notice, and so on. Another issue is pedestrians, who tend to fearlessly jaywalk more in Paris than in other French cities. Be prepared for pedestrians crossing the street on red, and expect similar adventurous behaviour from cyclists. Remember that even if a pedestrian or cyclist crossed on red, if you hit him, you (in fact, your insurance) will have to bear civil responsibility for the damages, and possibly prosecution for failing to control your vehicle.\\n\\nParis has several beltway systems. There is a series of boulevards named after Napoleonic-era generals (\\'\\'Boulevard Massena\\'\\', \\'\\'Boulevard Ney\\'\\', and so forth), and collectively referred to as \\'\\'boulevard des marechaux\\'\\'. These are normal wide avenues, with traffic lights. Somewhat outside of this boulevard is the \\'\\'boulevard peripherique\\'\\', a freeway-style beltway. The \\'\\'peripherique interieur\\'\\' is the inner lanes (going clockwise), the \\'\\'peripherique exterieur\\'\\' the outer lanes (going counter-clockwise). Note that despite the looks, the \\'\\'peripherique\\'\\' is not an \\'\\'autoroute\\'\\': the speed limit is 70 and, very unusually, incoming traffic has the right of way, at least theoretically (presumably because, otherwise, nobody would be able to enter during rush hour).\\n\\n===By taxi===\\n\\n{{Infobox|To stop a taxi...|... watch the sign on the roof: if the white sign is lit, the cab is on duty and available, if the white sign is off and a colored light is lit under it (blue, orange), it\\'s on duty \\'\\'and\\'\\' busy, if the white sign is off and no coloured light is on, the taxi is off duty. Same thing with the colored signs (the two systems exist in Paris, but it tells nothing about the company): if the wide sign is green, the cab is available, if it is red, the cab is busy, if it is off, the cab is off}}\\n\\nTaxis are comparatively cheap especially at night when there are no traffic jams to be expected. There are not as many as one would expect, and sometimes finding a taxi can be challenging. In the daytime, it is not always a good idea to take a taxi, as walking or taking the metro (\\'\\'See: Metro\\'\\') will often be faster. If you know you will need one to get to the airport, or to a meeting, it is wise to book ahead by phone (see below).\\n\\nInitial fare is 2.40 and the meter increases by around 1.10 each kilometer and around 50 cents each minute spent at red lights or in traffic jams. Fares are fixed by the city law and every driver complies to them. Fares vary according to the day of the week, the hour of the day and the area you\\'re crossing.\\n\\nIf you call a taxi, the meter starts when you call and not when you get in. You should expect a 5 to 10 fare on the meter when the taxi arrives after you call it.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Remember\\'\\'\\' if a taxi is near a \\'taxi station\\', they\\'re not supposed to pick you up \\'\\'except\\'\\' at the station where there may be people waiting for a taxi. Taxi stations are usually near train stations, big hotels, hospitals, large crossings.\\n\\nThere are a number of services by which you can call for taxis or make a reservation in advance. The two largest fleet are Taxis G7 and Taxis Bleus:\\n\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Transport Parisien | alt=transfert roissy | url=http://www.transportparisien.com/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 6 61 57 43 53 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Taxis aeroport de Paris | alt=airport transfer | url=http://www.taxiaeroportparis.fr/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 6 58 79 38 87 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Taxi Paris | alt=taxi roissy | url=http://www.taxis-paris.org | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33658793887 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Taxis net Paris | url=http://www.taxiparis.org/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 6 24 14 15 69 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Taxis G7 | url=http://www.taxisg7.fr | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 47 39 47 39 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Taxis Bleus | url=http://www.taxis-bleus.com/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 891 70 10 10 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Taxis de France | url=http://www.taxis-de-france.com/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}} \\n* {{listing\\n| name=Taxi-Paris | url=http://www.taxi-paris.net | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 14 1276699 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Shuttle Taxi | alt=navette roissy | url=http://www.shuttle-paris.com/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 39 94 96 89 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Taxis aeroport Roissy | alt=taxi roissy | url=http://www.taxiaeroportparis.net/ | email=\\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 6 61 57 43 53 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\nAs in many other cities a taxi can be difficult to stop; you may have to try several times.  When you do get a taxi to stop, the driver will usually roll down his window to ask you where you want to go. If the driver can\\'t (or doesn\\'t want to) go where you want, he might tell you that he\\'s near the end of his work day & can\\'t possibly get you where you want before he has to go off-duty.\\n\\nThere is a 6.40 minimum (2012) on all taxi rides, mandated by city law, but the meter does not show this amount, which can result in being asked to pay more than the metered amount on short rides.  In Paris taxis are required by law to charge for the trip with a meter, charging a flat rate is illegal. Frequently the taxi driver will not want to drive you all the way to the doorstep, but will prefer to let you out a block or so away if there are one or more one-way streets to contend with.  Try to look at this as a cost-savings rather than an inconvenience.  You should pay while still seated in the cab as in New York and \\'\\'not\\'\\' through the front window London style.\\n\\nThe driver will not let you sit in the front seat (unless there are 3 or 4 of you, which is a rare case usually expedited by more money).  Taxi-drivers come in all types, some nice, some rude, some wanting to chat, some not. Smoking in taxis is generally not allowed, however it might be that the taxi driver himself wants a cigarette in which case the rule might become flexible.\\n\\nMany drivers prefer that you avoid using your cellphone during the ride; if you \\'\\'do have\\'\\' to, make an apologizing gesture & sound, and do make a \\'\\'\\'short\\'\\'\\' call.\\n\\n*A tip is included in the fare price; If you\\'re especially satisfied with the service, you can give something (basically 10%), but you don\\'t \\'\\'have\\'\\' to.\\n*There is an extra charge for baggage handling.\\n\\nIf for any reason you wish to file a complaint about a Paris taxi, take note of the taxi\\'s number on the sticker on the left hand backseat window.\\n\\nAlso if you take a taxi to the Charles de Gaulle airport be prepared to pay 70 or more because there is often heavy traffic. If there isn\\'t traffic it will be less expensive, but that is rare. The RER B or a bus is cheaper.\\n\\nBeware of illegal taxis (see the \\'Stay Safe\\' section).\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Livery or Black Car or Limos-\\'\\'\\' Known as car services or livery cabs, these cars may only be called by phone, are flat rate rather than metered (\\'\\'ask for the fare before getting in\\'\\'), and are not allowed to cruise the street or airports for fares. There are two types of licence: the \"Grande Remise\" that allows the car & driver to pick-up & drop-off passengers anywhere in France, and the \"carte verte\" that allows pick-up & drop-off in the department or region where the company is based. The Grande Remise cars have a GR on their front plate. They provide more service than a normal cab.\\n\\n===With children===\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'Metro and bus\\'\\'\\'. The metro and buses are free for children under the age of 4. Older kids (4-9) can buy a \\'\\'carnet\\'\\' (a collection of 10 tickets) at half-price for discounted travel. Other passes, including the Paris-Vistes pass for unlimited travel over 1 to 5 days are also available at half-price for children below 9 years of age.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Taxis\\'\\'\\'. Parisien taxis tend to be standard cars (sedans or minivans) so almost all strollers will need to be folded and placed in trunk. Be aware that taxi drivers are proud of their cars and keep them very clean and are not big fans of messy kids.\\n\\n==Talk==\\n\\nFirst and foremost, French (francais) is of course the country\\'s official language. Any native French person will speak French and it helps if you can speak a bit of it. In the parts of the city that tourists frequent the most (Tour Eiffel, Le Louvre, Champs-Elysees), the shopkeepers, information booth attendants, and other workers are likely to answer you in English, even if your French is advanced. These workers tend to deal with thousands of foreign-speaking tourists, and responding in English is often faster than repeating themselves in French. This is not the case for the rest of the city.\\n\\n{{Infobox|Reading up|Before you leave you may want to read a book like \\'\\'French or Foe\\'\\' by Polly Platt or \\'\\'Almost French\\'\\' by Sarah Turnbull  interesting, well written records from English speaking persons who live in France.}}\\n\\nFor most Parisians, English is something they had to study in school, and thus seems a bit of a chore. People helping you out in English are making an extra effort, sometimes a considerable one. Parisians younger than 40 are much more likely to be fluent in English. Immigrants, often working in service jobs, are less likely (often, still struggling to learn French.)  If it\\'s your first time in France you will have some problems understanding what people are saying (even with prior education in French). Unlike most language education tapes, real French people often speak fast, use slang, and swallow some letters.\\n\\nWhen attempting to speak French, do not be offended if people ask you to repeat, or seem not to understand you, as they are not acting out of snobbery. Keep your sense of humour, and if necessary, write down phrases or place names. And remember to speak slowly and clearly. Unless you have an advanced level and can at least sort of understand French movies, you should also assume that it will be difficult for people to understand what you are saying (imagine someone speaking English to you in an indiscernible accent, it\\'s all the same).\\n\\nWhen in need of directions what you should do is this:  find a younger person, or a person reading some book or magazine in English, who is obviously not in a hurry; say \"hello\" or \"\\'\\'bonjour\\'\\'\" (bon-zhor); start by asking if the person speaks English, \"Parlez-vous anglais?\" (Par-LAY voo on-glay?) even if the person can read something in English, speak slowly and clearly; write down place names if necessary. Smile a lot. Also, carry a map (preferably \\'\\'Paris par Arrondissement\\'\\'); given the complexity of Paris streets it is difficult to explain how to find any particular address in any language, no matter how well you speak it. If anything, the person may have an idea as to the place you are looking for, but may not know exactly where it may be, so the map always helps.\\n\\nOn the other hand you will probably get the cold shoulder if you stop a random person in the metro (like, say, some middle-aged hurried person who has a train to take), fail to greet them and say \"where is place X or street Y\".\\n\\nNow, if you speak French, remember two \\'\\'\\'magic phrases\\'\\'\\' : \"Excusez-moi de vous deranger\" [ex-kuh-zay mwuh duh voo day-rawn-ZHAY] (\"Sorry to bother you\") and \"Pourriez-vous m\\'aider?\" [por-EE-AY voo may-DAY] (\"Could you help me?\") especially in shops; politeness will work wonders.\\n\\nIt is considered polite to always say \"bonjour\" or \"bonsoir\" to employees when entering any type of shop even if you have no intention of buying anything.  Upon leaving you should say \"merci\" to thank the shopkeeper for allowing you to browse and say \"bonne journee\" (bun zhur-nay) or \"bonne soiree\" (bun swa-ray) to wish them a good day or evening.  \"Bonne nuit\" is only used when telling someone \"goodnight\" when going to bed.\\n\\n[[File:Pont des Arts, Paris.jpg|thumb|750px|center|The Pont des Arts (Bridge of the Arts) and just behind, the pont Neuf (\"New Bridge\", but actually the oldest in Paris) and the ile de la Cite.]]\\n\\n==See==\\n[[File:LouvreParis.jpg|thumb|Louvre Museum, and the Pyramid by architect I.M.

Note these are \"consecutive\\' days\". The card allows you to jump lengthy queues, a big plus during tourist season when line can be extensive, and is available from participating museums, tourist offices, FNAC branches and all the main Metro and RER train stations. You will still need to pay to enter most special exhibitions. To avoid waiting in the first long queue to purchase the museum pass, stop to purchase your pass a day or more in advance after mid-day. The pass does not become active until your first museum or site visit when you write your start date. After that, the days covered are consecutive. Do not write your start date until you are certain you will use the pass that day and be careful to use the European date style as indicated on the card: day-month-year.\\n\\nAlso consider the [http://www.parispass.com/ \\'\\'ParisPass\\'\\'], a pre-paid entry card + queue jumping to 60 attractions including The Louvre, The Arc de Triomphe, as well as a river cruise and allows free metro & public transport travel. Also note a cheaper alternative with this new combined pass available since September 2008 is the [http://www.conciergerie.com/paris/pass/paris-combo-pass-premium.php \\'\\'Paris ComboPass&reg;\\'\\'], which comes in Lite/Premium versions.\\n\\nPlanning your visits: Several sites have \"choke points\" that restrict the number of visitors that can flow through. These include: The Eiffel Tower, Sainte-Chapelle, the catacombs and the steps to climb to the top of the Notre Dame Cathedral. To avoid lines, you should start your day by arriving at one of these sites at least 30 minutes before opening time. Otherwise, expect a wait of at least an hour. Most museums and galleries are closed on either Monday or Tuesday. Examples: The Louvre museum is closed on Tuesdays while The Orsay Museum is closed on Mondays. Be sure to check museum closing dates to avoid disappointment! Also, most ticket counters close 30-45 min before final closing.\\n\\nAll national museums are open free of charge on the first Sunday of the month. However, this may mean long lines and crowded exhibits. Keep away from Paris during Easter week due to crowding. People have to queue up at the Eiffel Tower for several hours even early in the morning. However, this wait can be greatly reduced, if fit, by walking the first two levels, then buying an elevator ticket to the top. Entry to the permanent exhibitions at city-run museums is free at all times (admission is charged for temporary exhibitions).\\n\\nThese listings are just some \\'\\'\\'highlights\\'\\'\\' of things that you really should see if you can during your visit to Paris.

The busiest season is probably the fall, from a week or so after \\'\\'la rentree scolaire\\'\\' or \"back to school\" to around \\'\\'Noel\\'\\' (Christmas) theatres, cinemas and concert halls book their fullest schedule of the year.\\n\\nEven so, there are a couple of annual events in the winter, starting with a furniture and interior decorating trade fair called \\'\\'\\'[http://www.maison-objet.com/ Maison & Object]\\'\\'\\' in January.\\n\\nIn February \\'\\'le nouvel an chinois\\'\\' (\\'\\'\\'Chinese New Year\\'\\'\\') is celebrated in Paris as it is in every city with a significant Chinese and Vietnamese population. There are parades in the 3rd and 4th arrondissements and especially in the \\'\\'Quartier Asiatique\\'\\' (Asian Quarter) in the 13th south of Place d\\'Italie. Also in February is the \\'\\'\\'[http://www.rbs6nations.com/ Six Nations Rugby Tournament]\\'\\'\\' which brings together France, England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Italy.\\n\\nThe first of two Fashion weeks occurs in March: \\'\\'\\'Spring Fashion Week\\'\\'\\', giving designers a platform to present womens \\'\\'pret-a-porter\\'\\' (ready to wear) collections for the following winter.\\n\\nThe \\'\\'\\'[http://www.Frenchopen.org/ French Tennis Open]\\'\\'\\' in which the worlds top players battle it out on a clay court runs during two weeks starting on the last Sunday in May.  When it concludes in June, a whole range of festivities start up. \\'\\'\\'Rendez-vous au Jardin\\'\\'\\' is an open house for many Parisian gardens, giving you a chance to meet real Parisian gardeners and see their creations. The \\'\\'\\'[http://www.fetedelamusique.fr/ Fete de la Musique]\\'\\'\\' celebrates the summer solstice (21 June) with this city-wide free musical knees-up. Finally on the 26th of June is the \\'\\'\\'[http://www.gaypride.fr Gay Pride]\\'\\'\\' parade, featuring probably the most sincere participation by the mayor\\'s office of any such parade on the globe.\\n\\nThe French national holiday \\'\\'\\'Bastille Day\\'\\'\\' on the 14th of July celebrates the storming of the infamous Bastille during the French Revolution. Paris hosts several spectacular events that day of which the best known is the \\'\\'\\'Bastille Parade\\'\\'\\' which is held on the Champs-Elysees at 10:00 and broadcast to pretty much the rest of Europe by television. The entire street will be crowded with spectators so arrive early. The \\'\\'\\'Bastille Day Fireworks\\'\\'\\' is an exceptional treat for travellers lucky enough to be in town on Bastille Day. The Office du Tourisme et des Congress de Paris recommends gathering in or around the \\'\\'champ de Mars\\'\\', the gardens of the Eiffel Tower.\\n\\nAlso in July, \\'\\'\\'[http://www.villette.com/ Cinema en Plein Air]\\'\\'\\' is the annual outdoor cinema event that takes place at the Parc de la Villette, in the [[Paris/19th arrondissement|19th]] on Europes largest inflatable screen. For most of the  months of July and August, parts of both banks of the Seine are converted from expressway into an artificial beach for \\'\\'\\'[http://www.paris.fr/parisplages Paris Plages]\\'\\'\\'. Also in July the cycling race \\'\\'\\'le Tour de France\\'\\'\\' has a route that varies annually, however it always finishes on the last Sunday of July under the Arc de Triomphe.\\n\\nOn the last full weekend in August, a world-class music festival \\'\\'\\'[http://www.rockenseine.com/ Rock en Seine]\\'\\'\\' draws international rock and pop stars to the \\'\\'Domaine national de Saint-Cloud\\'\\', just west of Paris.\\n \\nDuring mid-September DJs and (usually young) fans from across Europe converge on Paris for five or six days of dancing etc. culminating in the \\'\\'\\'Techno parade\\'\\'\\' - a parade whose route traces roughly from \\'\\'Place de la Bastille\\'\\' to the \\'\\'Sorbonne\\'\\', and around the same time the festival \\'\\'\\'[http://www.jazzalavillette.com/ Jazz a la Villette]\\'\\'\\' brings some of the biggest names in contemporary jazz from around the world.\\n\\nThe \\'\\'\\'[http://www.paris.fr/ Nuit Blanche]\\'\\'\\' transforms most of central Paris into a moonlit theme-park for an artsy all-nighter on the first Saturday of October, and \\'\\'\\'[http://www.modeaparis.com Fashion Week]\\'\\'\\' returns shortly thereafter showing off Womens \\'\\'Pret-a-Porter\\'\\' collections for the following summer; as we\\'ve noted winter collections are presented in March.\\n\\nThe third Thursday in November marks the release of \\'\\'\\'[http://www.intowine.com/beaujolais2.html Le Beaujolais Nouveau]\\'\\'\\' and the beginning of the Christmas season. This evening, the Christmas lights are lit in a ceremony on the \\'\\'Champs-Elysees\\'\\', often in the presence of hundreds (if not thousands) of people and many dignitaries, including the president of France.\\n\\nUnfortunately, there are no comprehensive event guides covering concerts, clubs, movies or special events. For theatre, movies and exhibitions pick up the \\'\\'Pariscope\\'\\' and \\'\\'L\\'officiel du Spectacle\\'\\', available at newsstands for 0.40. For (especially smaller, alternative) concerts pick up LYLO, a small, free booklet available in some bars and at FNAC.

The French capital offers a spectacular array of photographic opportunities to the beginner and the pro alike. It has photogenic monuments (e.g., Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, the obelisk at Concorde, and countless others); architecture (the Louvre, Notre Dame and the Museum of the Arab World, to name just a few) and urban street scenes (e.g., in the Marais, Montmartre and Belleville). When you tire of taking your own photos, visit one of the many institutions dedicated to photography (e.g., European Museum of Photography, the Jeu de Paume Museum or the Henri Cartier Bresson Foundation). At these and other institutions, you can learn the about the rich history of Paris as the place of important developments in photography (e.g., the Daguerrotype) and as the home of many of the trade\\'s great artists (e.g., Robert Doisneau, Andre Kertesz, Eugene Atget and Henri Cartier Bresson).\\n\\n*{{do\\n| name=Better Paris Photos | url=http://www.betterparisphotos.com/tours | email=register@betterparisphotos.com\\n| address=32 Avenue de Suffren | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 6 74 04 21 84 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=By appointment, tours last from 4 hours | price=From 195/half day; 290/full day\\n| content=Better Paris Photos offers instructional tours and workshops that combine hands-on learning of essential photographic techniques with guiding to, and commentary about, the most photogenic spots of Paris.

The type of camera you have and your experience level doesn\\'t matter as Sab concentrates on developing the photographer\\'s \\'eye\\' and an appreciation for composition and capturing unexpected moments creatively.\\n}}\\n\\n===Movies===\\n\\nThe \\'\\'Cinemas\\'\\' of Paris are (or at least should be) the envy of the movie-going world.  Of course, like anywhere else you can see big budget first-run films from France and elsewhere.  That though, is just the start. During any given week there are at least half-a-dozen film festivals going on, at which you can see the entire works of a given actor or director.  Meanwhile there are some older cult films like say, \\'\\'What\\'s new Pussycat\\'\\' or \\'\\'Casino Royal\\'\\' which you can enjoy pretty much any day you wish.\\n\\nMany non-French movies are subtitled (called \"\\'\\'version originale\\'\\'\" \"VO\" or \"VOstfr\"  as opposed to \"VF\" for version francaise).\\n\\nThere are any number of ways to find out what\\'s playing, but the most commonly used guide is \\'\\'Pariscope\\'\\', which you can find at newsstands for 0.40. Meanwhile there are innumerable online guides which have information on \"every\" cinema in Paris.\\n\\n===Theatres===\\nThe [http://www.operadeparis.fr/en/ Paris Opera], as well as its associated ballet company, the Paris Opera Ballet, are considered to be among the premier classical performance companies in the world.\\n\\nIf you are under 26, there is a flat rate of 10 for every private theatre of the town every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday night. This fare does not apply to public theatres nor opera.\\n\\n===With children===\\n[[File:LuxembourgGardens.jpg|thumb|Luxembourg Gardens in September]]\\n* \\'\\'\\'Cite des enfants\\'\\'\\' in the [[Paris/19th arrondissement|19th]], a museum for kids within the Cite des Sciences et de l\\'Industrie, is interactive, fun, and educational. There are two separate sections for the 3-5 set and the 5-12 set. The tots section has simple exhibits designed to be pushed, prodded, and poked. The section for older kids is more sophisticated with scientific experiments and TV studios.  Metro \\'\\'Porte de la Villete\\'\\' (7)\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'Jardin du Luxembourg\\'\\'\\' in the [[Paris/6th arrondissement|6th]]. It would be counted as a travesty not to take your under 10 year old to the Jardin du Luxembourg, long a favourite with Parisian children. With its world famous merry-go-round, a pond for sail boats, a puppet theater, pony rides, chess players, children\\'s playground, it has something for every kid (with comfortable chairs for weary parents thrown in!). The marionettes du Luxembourg, the puppet theatre, stages classic French puppet shows in French but should be easy to understand. There are numerous places for a snack.  RER \\'\\'Luxembourg\\'\\' (B) or Metro \\'\\'Odeon\\'\\' (4, 10)\\n\\n*\\'\\'\\'Parc des Buttes-Chaumont\\'\\'\\' in the [[Paris/19th arrondissement|19th]].  Buttes-Chaumont is great for those with children that like to run, climb, and explore.  Built on the site of an abandoned quarry, the park is roughly bowl-shaped with a 30-meter-tall peak situated in the middle of a pond at the park\\'s center.  There are trails up the rock, caves, waterfalls, a suspension bridge, and a small stone gazebo on the top of the rock with a 360-degree view.  There is also a puppet theater and a playground.  Metro \\'\\'Buttes-Chaumont\\'\\' (7bis), \\'\\'Botzaris\\'\\' (7bis), or \\'\\'Laumiere\\'\\' (5)\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'Parc Zoologique\\'\\'\\' in the [[Paris/12th arrondissement|12th]]. Like all things in France, this zoo is different because of a 236 foot artificial mountain bang in its center. Take elevators to the top and enjoy the view or watch the mountain goats do their stuff on the sides. Lions, tigers, and everything designed to delight kids can be found in the zoo if the mountain doesn\\'t do it for your kids.  RER/Metro \\'\\'Gare d\\'Austerlitz\\'\\' (5, 10, C)\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'The Jardin d\\'Acclimatation\\'\\'\\' in the [[Paris/16th arrondissement|16th]] has a number of rides, including pint-sized roller coasters suitable for children as young as three years, as well as a mini-zoo and the estimable \\'\\'Musee en Herbe\\'\\'.

Unless you possess one of a number of in-demand skills, it will almost certainly be necessary to obtain a job offer from an employer before arriving. Your employer, for their part, will have to have the offer approved by the relevant governmental authorities, as well.  If you opt for unreported work, such as babysitting, you need not fret about going through the process to obtain a \\'\\'Carte de sejour\\'\\', i.e., a formal visitor\\'s identity card.  However, if you do choose a change in location, it is advisable to obtain a \\'\\'Carte de sejour\\'\\' prior to finding any job whatsoever, as the process can be longer than expected.  Note however that a \\'\\'Carte de sejour\\'\\' is often necessary to open a bank account and the like, and by extension for accomplishing any number of other tasks involved in modern life, so unless you\\'re very comfortable transacting everything in cash you should probably bite the bullet and keep things on the up-and-up.\\n\\nRemember, the city of Paris has a huge network of immigrants coming and going, and it is always great to tap into that network.  The city holds a great abundance of work ready to be found, even if it feels nerve wracking at first.\\n\\n==Buy==\\n\\nParis is one of the great \\'\\'\\'fashion\\'\\'\\' centres of the Western world, up there with [[New York City|New York]], [[London]], and [[Milan]], making it a shopper\\'s delight. While the Paris fashion scene is constantly evolving, the major shopping centres tend to be the same. High end couture can be found in the 8th arrondisement. In summer, there is nothing better than browsing the boutiques along Canal St-Martin, or strolling along the impressive arcades of the historic Palais-Royal, with beautifully wrapped purchases swinging on each arm.\\n\\nA good note about \\'\\'Le Marais\\'\\' is that as it is a mostly Jewish neighborhood, most of the shops in \\'\\'Le Marais\\'\\' are open on Sundays. The stores in this area are intimate, boutique, \"Parisian\" style clothing stores. You will no doubt find something along each street, and it is always well worth the look.\\n\\nOther great areas to shop around in are around the area Sevres Babylone (Metro Line 10 and Line 12).  It is in this area you will find the Le Bon Marche [[Paris/7th arrondissement|7th]], particularly \\'\\'rue de Cherche Midi\\'\\' [[Paris/6th arrondissement|6th]].  The area boasts some of the major fashion houses (Chanel, Jean Paul Gaultier, Versace, etc.) and also has smaller private boutiques with handmade clothing.\\n\\nIn the \\'\\'Quartier Saint-Germain-des-Pres\\'\\', you can find a handful of vintage clothing shops, carrying anything from couture early 20th century dresses, to 70s Chanel sunglasses.  Walking along \\'\\'Boulevard Saint-Germain\\'\\', you will find major brands. However, if in search of eclectic finds, opt to walk the northern side of the Boulevard, especially along \\'\\'rue Saint Andre des Arts\\'\\', where you can always find a nice cafe to stop in. The area south of Saint-Germain is just as nice, and comes with a price tag to match.\\n\\nIn the artsy quarters of 1 and 4, there are many bargains to be had, once again, if you are prepared to look. Souvenirs are easily found and can be fairly inexpensive as long as you don\\'t buy from the tourist sites. For cheap books of French connection, try the University/Latin quarter as they sell books in all languages starting from half a euro each.\\n\\n===Flea Markets===\\nParis has 3 main flea-markets, all on the outskirts of the central city. The most famous of these is the \\'\\'\\'Marche aux Puces de St-Ouen (Porte de Clignancourt)\\'\\'\\' (Clignancourt Flea Market), \\'\\'Metro: Porte de Clignancourt\\'\\', in the [[Paris/18th arrondissement#Buy|18th]], a haven for lovers of antiques, second-hand goods, and retro fashion. The best days to go are Saturday and Sunday. Note that there are particular times of the week when only antique collectors are allowed into the stalls, and there are also times of the day when the stall owners take their \\'\\'Parisian siesta\\'\\', and enjoy a leisurely cappuccino for an hour or so. The best times to visit the flea markets are in the spring and summertime, when the area is more vibrant. In and around the metro station, you may find the area a little wild, but still safe.\\n\\n===Musical Instruments===\\nRue de Rome, situated near Gare St. Lazare, is crowded with luthiers, brass and woodwind makers, piano sellers, and sheet music stores. Subway station Europe. The area south of the metro station Pigalle is also packed with music shops (more oriented towards guitars and drums).\\n\\n===Artwork===\\nFor art lovers, be sure to check out \\'\\'Quartier Saint-Germain-des-Pres\\'\\', which is renowned for its galleries, and it is impossible to turn a street without finding a gallery to cast your glance in. On Fridays, most open until late. Most even have the benefit of bottles of wine so you can wander in with your glass of wine and feel very \\'\\'artistique\\'\\'. Great roads to walk along are \\'\\'rue de Seine\\'\\', \\'\\'rue Jacob\\'\\', \\'\\'rue des Beaux Arts\\'\\', \\'\\'Rue Bonaparte\\'\\', and \\'\\'Rue Mazarine\\'\\'.\\nAlso, be sure to visit the historical district of \\'\\'Montparnasse\\'\\' and \\'\\'quartier Vavin\\'\\' where artists like Modigliani, Gauguin and Zadkine used to work.\\n\\n==Eat==\\nParis is one of Europe\\'s culinary centres. The restaurant trade began here just over 220 years ago and continues to thrive.  It may however come as a surprise that Paris isn\\'t considered the culinary capital of France, rather some people prefer the French cooking found in small rural restaurants, outside of the city, closer to the farms and with their focus on freshness and regional specialities. Even among French cities, Paris has long been considered by some people as second to [[Lyon]] for fine dining.\\n\\nThere have been other challenges in the last 20 years or so as restaurateurs in places like [[San Francisco]] and [[Sydney]] briefly surpassed their Parisian fore bearers, again with an emphasis on freshness of ingredients but also borrowings from other cuisines. Parisian cooks didn\\'t just rest on their laurels during this time, rather they travelled, taught, and studied, and together with Paris\\'s own immigrant communities,  have revitalized the restaurant trade. Today you can find hundreds of beautiful restaurants with thoughtful (or just trendy) interior design and well-planned and executed \\'\\'cartes\\'\\' and \\'\\'menus\\'\\' offering a creative \\'\\'melange\\'\\' of French and exotic foreign cuisines. It\\'s safe to say that Paris is once again catching up with or edging ahead of its \\'\\'Anglophone\\'\\' rivals.\\n\\nOf course there are also some traditional offerings, and for the budget conscious there are hundreds of traditional bistros, with their sidewalk \\'\\'terraces\\'\\' offering a choice of fairly simple (usually meat centred) meals for reasonable prices.\\n\\nFor the uninitiated, it is unfortunately possible to have a uniformly poor dining experience during a stay in Paris, mainly because many attractions are situated in upscale areas of town, and that mass tourism attracts price gougers. It is frequent to hear of people complaining of very high Parisian prices for poor food and poor service, because they always tried to eat close to major tourist magnets. For good food and great service, try to go eat where the locals eat.\\n\\nMany restaurants are tiny and have tables close together - square metres are at a premium and understandably restaurateurs need to make the most of limited space. In some cases when the restaurant is crowded, you may have to sit beside strangers at the same table. If that does not appeal to you, go to a more upscale place where you will pay for the extra space.\\n\\nTrendy restaurants often require reservations weeks, if not months in advance. If you haven\\'t planned far enough ahead, try to get a reservation for lunch which is generally easier and less expensive.\\n\\nFor an easy-to-manage eating budget while in Paris, consider: breakfast or \"petit dejeuner\" at a restaurant, possibly in your hotel, consisting of some croissants, coffee, and maybe a piece of fruit. Get a \\'walking lunch\\' from one of Paris\\' many food standsa \\'\\'panino\\'\\' in the centre of the city, a crepe from a crepe stand, a felafel pita or take-out Chinese in the Marais. \\'\\'Traiteurs\\'\\' serving Chinese and/or Vietnamese food are ubiquitous in the city and good for a cheap lunch and many \\'\\'patisseries\\'\\' sell inexpensive coffee and sandwiches. All these are cheap (about the same as breakfast), easy, and allow you to maximize your sightseeing and walking time while enjoying delicious local or ethnic food.  For dinner, stroll the streets at dusk and consider a 20-40 prix-fixe menu. This will get you 3 or 4 courses, possibly with wine, and an unhurried, candlelit, magical European evening. If you alternate days like this with low-budget, self-guided eating (picnicking, snacking, street food) you will be satisfied without breaking the bank.\\n\\nIf one of the aims of your trip to Paris is to indulge in its fine dining, though, the most cost-effective way to do this is to make the main meal of your day lunch. Virtually all restaurants offer a good prix-fixe deal. By complementing this with a bakery breakfast and a light self-catered dinner, you will be able to experience the best of Parisian food and still stick to a budget.\\n\\n===Self catering===\\nBudget travellers will be very pleased with the range and quality of products on offer at the open air markets (e.g. the biggest one on Boulevard Richard Lenoir (near the Bastille), Rue Mouffetard, Place Buci, Place de la Madeleine and over the Canal Saint-Martin in the [[Paris/11th arrondissement|11th]] or in any other arrondissement). If your accommodation has cooking facilities you\\'re set, especially for wine and cheese, a decent bottle of French wine will set you back all of about 3-5, while the \\'\\'fairly good\\'\\' stuff starts at around 7. Bottles for less than 3 are not recommended.\\nKeep in mind that the small \\'\\'epiceries\\'\\' which open until late are more expensive than the \\'\\'supermarches\\'\\' (Casino, Monoprix, Franprix, etc.). For wine, the price difference can be up to 2.\\n\\nBuy a baguette, some cheese and a good bottle of wine and join the Parisian youth for a \\'\\'pique-nique\\'\\' along the Seine (especially on the Ile Saint-Louis) or along the Canal Saint-Martin. The finest food stores are Lafayette Gourmet in the Galeries Lafayette or La Grande Epicerie in the luxury department store Le Bon Marche. They are worth discovering. You will find a large variety of wines there, otherwise try  wine stores such as Nicolas or Le Relais de Bacchus (all over the city).\\n\\n===Some specialities===\\n\\nFor \\'\\'\\'seafood\\'\\'\\' lovers, Paris is a great place to try \\'\\'moules frites\\'\\' (steamed mussels and French fries) (better in fall and winter), oysters, sea snails, and other delicacies. \\'\\'\\'Meat\\'\\'\\' specialties include venison (deer), boar, and other game (especially in the fall and winter hunting season), as well as French favourites such as lamb, veal, beef, and pork.\\n\\n===Prices===\\nEating out in Paris can be expensive. However don\\'t believe people when they say you can\\'t do Paris on the cheap - you can! The key is to stay away from the beaten tracks and the obviously expensive Champs Elysees. Around the lesser visited quarters especially, there are many cheap and yummy restaurants to be found. The area around Fontaine Saint-Michel, the fountain facing Notre Dame is crowded by particularly tasty places to eat, with good ambiance, cheap prices and excellent service, with the advantage of being very centric of many places of interest. The key is to order from the prix-fixe menu, and \\'\\'not\\'\\' off the A la Carte menu unless you want to pay an arm and a leg. In many places a three course meal can be found for about 15. This way you can sample the food cheaply and is usually more \"French\". Ask for \"une carafe d\\'eau\" (oon karaaf doe) to get free tap water.\\n\\n===Kosher dining===\\nParis has the largest number of Kosher restaurants in any European city. Walk up and down Rue des Rosiers to see the variety and choices available from Israeli, Sushi, Italian and others. You will also find a wide assortment of Kosher restaurants in the 9th arrondissement of Paris near the rue Richer and rue Cadet areas. See the district guides for examples. Kosher restaurants and snacks usually display a big orange rectangle on their front, which ensure clients that they are Beth din certified.\\n\\n===Vegetarian dining===\\n<!-- please put individual restaurant listings in the appropriate arrondissement page -->\\n\\nFor \\'\\'\\'vegetarians\\'\\'\\', eating traditional French food will require some improvisation, as it is heavily meat-based. That being said, Paris has several excellent vegetarian restaurants, and many non-vegetarian restaurants will provide vegetarian dishes.\\n\\nWhen eating in a traditional restaurant, be careful before ordering dishes labelled as \"vegetarian\". Many French people presume that \\'\\'fish\\'\\' and \\'\\'seafood\\'\\' are vegetarian dishes. This is a widely spread misunderstanding all around the country. Additionally, French people tend to confuse \"real\" vegetarians with vegans. When explaining that you\\'re a vegetarian that won\\'t eat fish, people will often presume that you won\\'t eat milk or egg-based products.\\n\\nLook for spots such as Aquarius in the \\'\\'\\'[[Paris/14th arrondissement|14th]]\\'\\'\\' or and Le Grenier de Notre-Dame in the \\'\\'\\'[[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]]\\'\\'\\' just to name a few.  See the arrondissement pages for more listings. For fast food and snacks, you can always find a vegetarian sandwich or pizza. Even a kebab shop can make you something with just cheese and salad, or perhaps falafel.\\n\\nThere are also lots of Italian, Thai, Indian, and Mezo-American places where you will have little problem. The famous South Indian chain Saravana Bhavan have their branch near Gare Du Nord. In Rue des Rosiers (4th arrondissement) you can get delicious falafel in the many Jewish restaurants. Another place to look for falafel is on Rue Oberkampf  (11th arrondissement). Take away falafel usually goes for 5 or less.\\n\\nMoroccan and Algerian cooking is common in Paris - vegetarian couscous is lovely. Another good option for vegetarians - are traiteurs, particularly around Ledru Rollin (down the road from Bastille) take away food where you can combine a range of different options such as pomme dauphinoise, dolmas, salads, vegetables, nice breads and cheeses and so on.\\n\\nLebanese restaurants and snack shops abound as well, offering a number of vegetarian \\'\\'mezze\\'\\', or small plates.  The stand-bys of course are hummas, falafel, and baba-ganouche (\\'\\'caviar d\\'aubergine\\'\\').  A good place to look for Lebanese is in the pedestrian zone around Les Halles and Beaubourg in the [[Paris/1st arrondissement|1st]] and [[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th]].\\n\\n===Tourists and locals===\\n\\nWhen you are looking for a restaurant in Paris, be wary of those where the staff speak English a bit too readily. These restaurants are usually - but not always - geared towards tourists. It does make a difference in the staff\\'s service and behaviour whether they expect you to return or not.\\n\\nSometimes the advertised fixed price tourist menus (10-15) are a good deal. If you\\'re interested in the really good and more authentic stuff (and if you have learned some words of French) try one of the small bistros where the French go during lunch time.\\n\\n==Drink==\\n\\nThe bars scene in Paris really does have something for everyone. From bars which serve drinks in baby bottles, to ultra luxe clubs that require some name dropping, or card (black Amex) showing, and clubs where you can dance like no one\\'s watching, (although they will be). To start your night out right, grab a drink or two in a ubiquitous dive bar, before burning up the dance floor and spreading some cash, at one of the trendy clubs.\\n\\n*\\'\\'\\'Canal St Martin\\'\\'\\'.  Many cozy cafes and other drinking establishments abound around the \\'\\'Canal St Martin\\'\\' in the \\'\\'\\'[[Paris/10th arrondissement|10th]]\\'\\'\\'.\\n*\\'\\'\\'The Marais\\'\\'\\'. The Marais has a large number of trendier new bars mostly in the \\'\\'\\'[[Paris/4th arrondissement|4th]]\\'\\'\\' and to a lesser extent the \\'\\'\\'[[Paris/3rd arrondissement|3rd]]\\'\\'\\' with a few old charmers tossed into the mix.  A number of bars and restaurants in the Marais have a decidedly gay crowd, but are usually perfectly friendly to straights as well. Some seem to be more specifically aimed at up-and-coming hetero singles.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Bastille\\'\\'\\'.  There is a very active nightlife zone just to the northeast of Place de Bastille centered around \\'\\'rue de Lappe\\'\\', \\'\\'rue de la Roquette\\'\\', \\'\\'rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine\\'\\' (especially the amazing Club Barrio Latino) and \\'\\'rue de Charonne\\'\\' in the \\'\\'\\'[[Paris/11th arrondissement|11th]]\\'\\'\\'. Many of the bars closest to Bastille have either a North, Central, or South American theme, with a couple of Aussie places mixed in for good measure, and as you continue up \\'\\'rue de Charonne\\'\\' the cafes have more of a traditionally French but grungy feeling.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Quartier Latin - Odeon\\'\\'\\'. If you\\'re looking for the \\'\\'nouvelle vague\\'\\' (new wave) style, student and intellectual atmosphere of Paris in the 60s and 70s, you\\'ll find a lot of that (and more hip + chique) places in the quartier Latin and between place Odeon and the Seine. The neighborhood is also home of many small artsy cinemas showing non-mainstream films and classics (check \\'Pariscope\\' or \\'l\\'officiel du spectacle\\' at any newspaper stand for the weekly programme).\\n*\\'\\'\\'Rue Mouffetard and environs\\'\\'\\'. The area in the \\'\\'\\'[[Paris/5th arrondissement|5th]]\\'\\'\\' on the south side of the hill topped by the Pantheon has a little bit of everything for the nighthawk, from the classy cafes of Place de la Contrescarpe to an Irish-American dive bar just down the way to a hip, nearly hidden jazz cafe at the bottom of the hill.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Chatelet\\'\\'\\'. In some ways the \\'\\'Marais\\'\\' starts here in the \\'\\'\\'[[Paris/1st arrondissement|1st]]\\'\\'\\' between \\'\\'Les Halles\\'\\' and \\'\\'Hotel de Ville\\'\\' but with between all of the tourists and the \\'\\'\\'venerable Jazz clubs\\'\\'\\' on \\'\\'rue des Lombards\\'\\' the area deserves some special attention.  \\n*\\'\\'\\'Montmartre\\'\\'\\'. You\\'ll find any number of cozy cafes and other drinking establishments all around the \\'\\'Butte Montmartre\\'\\' in the \\'\\'\\'[[Paris/18th arrondissement|18th]]\\'\\'\\', especially check out \\'\\'rue des Abbesses\\'\\' near the \\'\\'Metro\\'\\' station of the same name.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Oberkampf-Menilmontant\\'\\'\\'. If you are wondering where to find the hipsters (\\'\\'bobos\\'\\' for bohemian-bourgeois), then this is where to look. There are \\'\\'several\\'\\' clusters of grungy-hip bars all along \\'\\'rue Oberkampf\\'\\' in the \\'\\'\\'[[Paris/11th arrondissement|11th]]\\'\\'\\', and stretching well into the \\'\\'\\'[[Paris/20th arrondissement|20th]]\\'\\'\\' up the hill on \\'\\'rue de Menilmontant\\'\\'. It\\'s almost like being in [[San Francisco]]\\'s [[San Francisco/Haight-Fillmore District|Haight-Fillmore]] district.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Bagnolet\\'\\'\\'.  There are a cluster of bar/restaurant/nightclubs along the southern end of the Pere Lachaise cemetery in the [[Paris/20th arrondissement|20th]] including probably the best place in Paris for nightly local and touring punk rock.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Rues des Dames-Batignolles\\'\\'\\'.  Another good place to find the grungy-chic crowd is the northern end of the \\'\\'\\'[[Paris/17th arrondissement|17th]]\\'\\'\\' around \\'\\'rue des Dames\\'\\' and \\'\\'rue des Batignolles\\'\\', and if you decide you want something a little different Montmartre is just around the corner.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Port de Tolbiac\\'\\'\\'. This previously deserted stretch of the river Seine in the \\'\\'\\'[[Paris/13th arrondissement|13th]]\\'\\'\\' was reborn as a center for nightlife (and Sunday-afternoon-life) a few years ago when an electronic music cooperative opened the \\'\\'\\'Batofar\\'\\'\\'. Nowadays there are a number of boats moored along the same \\'\\'quai\\'\\', including a boat with a Caribbean theme, and one with an Indian restaurant.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Saint Germain des Pres\\'\\'\\'. This area has two of the most famous cafes in the world: Cafe de Flore and Les Deux Magots, both catering to the tourists and the snobs who can afford their high prices. This part of the \\'\\'\\'[[Paris/6th arrondissement|6th]]\\'\\'\\' is where the Parisian cafe scene really started, and there still are hundreds of places to pull up to a table, order a glass, and discuss Sartre deep into the evening.\\n\\nFor individual bar listings see the various Arrondissement pages under \\'\\'\\'Drink\\'\\'\\'.\\n\\nOf course there are lots of interesting places which are sort of off on their own outside of these clusters, including a few like the \\'\\'\\'Hemingway Bar at the Ritz\\'\\'\\' which are not to be missed in a serious roundup of Parisian drinking, so check out the listings even in those arrondissements we haven\\'t mentioned above.\\n\\nSome nightclubs in Paris that are worth it: Folies Pigalle (pl. Pigalle, 18th, very trashy, 20), Rex Club (near one of the oldest cinemas on earth, the Grand Rex, house/electro, about 15).  You might also want to try Cabaret (Palais Royal), Maison Blanche, le Baron (M Alma-Marceau).  Remember when going out to dress to impress, you are in Paris!  Torn clothing and sneakers are not accepted.  The better you look, the more likely you will get past the random decisions of club bouncers. Also important to remember if male (or in a group of guys) that it will be more difficult to enter clubs; try to always have an equal male/female ratio.\\n\\n==Sleep==\\n=== Hotels ===\\nBeing often declared the most popular travel destination in the world, Paris has far over a thousand hotels to choose from, and even more in the surrounding [[Ile-de-France]] region. The choice may be overwhelming, but should be made carefully. There are huge differences in standards and location is key to make your stay in Paris enjoyable and time used well. Be prepared to pay the price for Paris\\' popularity - even the cheap hotels are relatively expensive.\\n\\nDespite the popularity with tourists, global hotel chains have relatively low penetration of the Parisian market. A notable exception is the French-based Accor, which boasts over 300 hotels in the Paris area, although with large swathes of central Paris largely uncovered. There is a fair amount of Best Westerns as well, but most international chains limit their presence to very few exclusive (and expensive) hotels in key locations. Travellers loyal to a particular brand may find their loyalty challenged, be forced to pay for it (rather than be rewarded) or unable to find their hotel brand of choice in Paris.\\n\\nHotels in the central arrondissements tend to be expensive, although very cheap ones can also be found. With few exceptions, they tend to offer small rooms - be aware of the fact that the difference in price between hotels can translate into difference in service, facility and appointment levels, but not necessarily room size. Rooms of 12-16 square metres (which is roughly half of standard hotels rooms e.g. in the USA) are the norm in central Paris, regardless of hotel standards.\\n\\nCheaper hotels in popular arrondissements tend to be older, less attractive properties, whose facilities and appointments may be very worn and outdated, far behind standards one would expect from the capital of all things pretty and fine. Even updated and restored hotels may exhibit wide variance in standards between room categories, and keep some of the rooms not refurbished or only minimally touched up to be able to offer attractive, eye-catching pricing for them and then upsell to more comfortable room categories. Always check out latest reviews, preferably with photos, to precisely determine what to expect from a given hotel and given room category.\\n\\nHotels outside of the city centre, or even outside of the \\'\\'Peripherique\\'\\' and Paris itself, can be far cheaper and better value for money than ones in central Paris, while still having good transit links via metro or RER. That said, you should check thoroughly how far from the metro / RER station the given hotel is, and whether the connection to the POIs you want to visit is direct, quick and easy. Do also factor in the added cost of transportation to outer zones, as well as the time spent to travel to and from the city and obviously resulting limitations.\\n\\nBecause of local preferences, a bathtub in the bathroom is a norm in most hotels, even if it means squeezing it into a very small bathroom, further limiting space. If you prefer a walk-in shower, you need to look for a hotel that specifically offers those (called \"\\'\\'douche italienne\\'\\'\" by the French), and you should generally look at newer, purpose-built properties.\\n\\nParis hotels, almost without regard to category or price, observe high and low seasons.  These differ slightly from one hotel to another, but usually the high season roughly corresponds to late spring and summer, and possibly a couple of weeks around the Christmas season.\\n\\nFor individual hotel listings see the various [[#Districts|Arrondissement]] pages. <!-- please add individual hotel listings on the various Arrondissement pages -->\\n\\n=== Apartment rentals ===\\nFor those staying for a week or more, renting a furnished apartment might be a more comfortable and money-saving option, especially for 3 or more adults. Furnished apartments can differ considerably in location and quality, offer different accommodations and selections of appliances and kitchen features, or may be well-above street level with no elevator.  Expect apartment sizes to be modest.  Access to local public transport can also vary widely. So choose carefully only after getting a full description of an interesting property.\\n\\nMany websites will help you find rentals. Some do a more disciplined job of locating and describing properties and their locale. Most charge a commission of 10% or more; some offer insurance covering some risks.  Some may offer a few apartments for shorter stays, usually at somewhat higher cost per day.\\n\\nIn late-spring and summer months, desirable properties may be in short supply.  If your plans are fairly firm for those periods, you would be wise to \"reserve\" a unit well in-advance.  Owners will often ask for a non-refundable deposit of up to 50% of the total cost of your stay.  Means of payment can range from money order to PayPal or (occasionally) charge card.  (Take great care of how and with whom you share any charge card account number.)  You should send no payment to any post office box or similarly anonymous place or account...even after exchanging e-mails with a purported owner; most are no more than \"blind\" scams to take your money.\\n\\nThe city government has recently passed ordinances that require owners renting properties for short periods to collect a tax previously collected only by hotels. This substantial tax may not be collected by some owners, or may be demanded by them but not mentioned in their rates until you arrive.  Tax enforcement and collection remain in a state of flux.\\n\\nAlso note that some agencies, rental brokers or web sites, that seem amicable, attractive or claim reputations, do not abide by French law to carefully vet and select landlords and apartments they offer for rent. There are a certain number of guarantees, which are required in France before renting an apartment, and an insurance policy, which aims at protecting the tenants during their stay.\\n\\n==Stay safe==\\n\\n===Crime===\\nThough Paris is a safe city, there has been a significant rise in petty [[crime]] in recent years, especially [[pickpocketing]]. It is only some of the outer suburbs of the metropolitan area (the \\'\\'banlieues\\'\\') such as Clichy-sous-Bois and Bondy which one would consider \\'rough\\' by western standards. The most prevalent crime by far is petty [[theft]]. Pickpockets and scams, of which there are many, are the most common crime. While not common, purse snatching and muggings do happen. Violent crime is rare. Watch yourself at ATMs and other places where your cash may be visible. Keep your money in front pockets, and avoid ATMs that are open to the outside, especially at night.\\n\\nThe police can be reached by phone by dialing 17. Not all police officers speak English, but those found around touristy areas almost always will. They are usually friendly and perfectly approachable should you have to.\\n\\n==== Theft in public transit ====\\nThe metro is also a popular place for pickpockets. \\'\\'\\'Hold things tightly and be aware of your surroundings.\\'\\'\\' While trains are usually crowded, if someone is insisting and hovers over you, they are probably going through your pockets. It is important to know that a majority of these belong to a gang. These gangs usually use young children as young as seven, with groups of them going around the metro stations pickpocketing tourists and locals alike. If there is a group of three or more suspicious looking people, be careful of your belongings.\\n\\nCommon tactics are two of them blocking you as you try to board the subway, with two behind you quickly going through your bag. Seconds before the doors close, the two jump off, leaving you on the metro without even realizing what has happened. Take note of what locals do. If someone warns you to be careful, there are probably some suspicious types hoping to steal from you. Also be aware that phone-snatching is the most reported crime, and avoid using your cellphone on metro platforms and in the metro itself.\\n\\nPickpockets are active on the rail link (RER B) from Charles de Gaulle airport to downtown Paris, which passes through the poor suburbs of Seine-Saint Denis. Try to take the trains which are nonstop between the airport and Paris proper (Gare du Nord) - EKLI/EKIL from Paris to CDG and KRIN/KROL from CDG to Paris. These are faster and are less crowded than the alternative.\\n\\nThere have also been problems with thieves physically fighting people in order to steal their belongings. The most common targets are those with suitcases and backpacks, i.e. tourists. Thieves usually coin their acts with the closing of the doors. Newer trains have cameras everywhere, and thieves are much less likely to use them. Otherwise, stow luggage on the racks above the seat (which is not possible in newer trains) and hold on to your bags so no one can grab them and then run out. You are much less likely of being a victim if the train is crowded with locals headed to work, usually at rush hour.\\n\\nThe train conductors are widely aware of these crimes and will usually wait a few seconds to leave the station after the doors have closed, just in case thieves have quickly jumped off with belongings. There are also emergency cords that one can pull if willing to chase after the attackers. People will usually be helpful and gladly call the police if you do not have a cell phone.\\n\\n==== Theft in tourist hotspots ====\\nPickpockets are most likely to be found working at crowded tourists hotspots, so keep your wallet and phone in your front pockets and hold your backpack tightly when in a crowd.\\n\\nA common place for phone/camera/wallet snatching is in tourist friendly dining areas scattered all over Paris where exposed outdoor tables are commonly right on busy sidewalks. Common practice by many Western tourists is to leave an aforementioned item of value on the table (most commonly a smartphone) in front of them. Some of the criminals, working in groups of three to five people, approach your table and shove what appears to be a survey directly under your nose thus blocking your view of your valuable. While the gang members are yelling in a foreign language another one will slip a hand below your view and take your item of value from the table. This occurs very quickly (less than five seconds) and the perpetrators disappear around the corner just as quick as they arrived.\\n\\nKey landmarks like the Louvre or the Eiffel tower have been plagued with gangs of pickpockets, which typically operate in groups of about five. As many as half a dozen of these gangs may be active at a particularly famous, crowded venue at any one time; occasionally there are fights between rival gangs of thieves. Asian visitors are often targeted due to a presumption that they are visiting from affluent nations. Venue staff have complained of being spat at, threatened, abused or assaulted by pickpocketing gangs; the Louvre closed briefly in 2013 (as did the Eiffel tower in 2015) due to worker protests of unsafe conditions due to criminal activity. Token attempts to deploy more police have not solved the problems.<!-- http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32844573 -->\\n\\n==== Scams ====\\n[[File:People at Montmartre \"selling\" trinkets.JPG|right|thumb|The men who will try to tie strings on your fingers]]\\nAt Sacre-Cur (called Montmartre by the locals), there are many men who will try to tie strings on your finger. Not only will they demand an obscene fee for the cheap trinkets (usually over 15), they will also try to pickpocket you or threaten you with force if you do not give them money. They are usually only at the base of the monument and can be avoided by taking the Funicular of Montmartre. Otherwise, you can quickly walk past them and ignore them, though they will readily grab people\\'s arms. Yelling at them may cause unwanted attention and cause them to back off, but be careful. Sacre-Cur appears to be the only area where they congregate, but they have been sighted also near the Eiffel Tower.\\n\\nBesides them, you will notice many people walking around with cheap trinkets at touristic areas, especially the Trocadero, Eiffel Tower, and Louvre Museum. They are generally not rude but bear in mind that buying things from them is illegal and hurts small businesses. This of course causes them to bolt at the sight of the police, and you may end up in the middle of a stampede!\\n\\nBe careful around Barbes-Rochechouart and the bars near Moulin Rouge. A very common trick is played here which might cost you up to 500. The agents standing outside will force you to enter a bar and just have a look for 5 minutes. The moment you order a drink (about 5), a girl will approach you and start talking generally, and leave in 1015 minutes. After a harmless conversation with the girls when you request a bill, you will encounter a charge of say 200-500 as \\'service fees\\' for the services rendered by the girl! In case you resist paying, the bouncers will start intimidating you to try to extract money from your wallet. In such cases, threaten them that you are calling the police and informing the local embassy. Try to buy some time and start creating a ruckus. However, do not try to start a fight with the bouncers. Note that this trick is common to many European big cities.\\n\\nOne scam involves a \"helpful\" local buying a ticket for you. Normally, tourists buy 1-day, 3-day or longer Paris Visite passes. They would tell you that your single trip ticket has expired and bring you to the ticketing machine to purchase day passes. Then they would select the 3 day pass for adults (even though you may be a student) and deliberately show you the price on the screen. Everything else is in French so you would not understand a thing. They would proceed to purchase with a credit card and while entering the PIN code, get you to turn your back on them. They then sneakily change the ticket to a single trip ticket and ask for payment for a 3-day ticket from you. Unsuspecting tourists would pay the full sum thinking it is a 1-day or 3-day pass when it is only a useless ticket. Buy the tickets yourself to avoid situations like these, as machines are available in English and other languages. If you feel threatened, call the police and don\\'t physically handle the ticket if they forcibly purchase without your agreement.\\n\\nAnother common scam is found along the banks of the Seine river and involves a ring. This involves thieves \"finding\" a ring which they give to you. They then ask you if you own it. When you say no, they insist you keep it, saying it goes against their religion or they cannot wear rings. A few moments later, they ask you for money to buy something to eat, eventually following you and becoming more annoying. You can either yell at them or steer them towards an area where there are likely to be police present, at which point they will quickly run away.\\n\\nThe most common scam (besides pickpocketing) that has taken over Paris by storm since June 2011 involves women coming up to tourists with pledge sheets. They pretend to be deaf people collecting money for one charity or another. Once you are distracted with the petition, an accomplice pickpockets you and takes your belongings. In addition, once you sign, they point to a thing that reads \"minimum ten euro donation.\" While they may at first insist on this, shaking your head and walking away will usually make them pester someone else. Otherwise, simply waving them off and a loud no should make them give up. If they are in a large group, as is common, be careful of your belongings! This is a ploy to pickpocket you as you are surrounded by them. At this point, yelling for the police will make them disperse quickly. This is most commonly found around major tourist sites, but has also been a problem at Gare du Nord, though this has gotten much better.\\n\\nNever bet money on a 3 card game as you will always lose. This trick is played by con artists on some of the bridges on River Seine near the Eiffel Tower.\\n\\nIt is a good idea to steer clear of the suburb of Seine Saint-Denis, as this suburb is known for its gangs and poverty, though there is of little interest to a tourists anyway (except the Basilique de Saint-Denis, but that is located near a metro station). You may want to avoid walking alone at night in the 18th and 19th arrondissements as well, as these can be a little shady at night. There is a large problem with youths from the depressed suburbs causing trouble with the police. If locals are moving away, it is most likely from a confrontation. While these groups rarely target people besides the police, be careful. Walk away from a situation that could lead to fights or worse.\\n\\nIn general, remember to be aware of pickpockets, as they act by trying to distract you. Avoid showing off expensive phones or a lot of money in public transportation or in open areas. Put your things in a money belt or your front pockets, but never in the back pockets.\\n\\n====Danger for identifiably Jewish people====\\nBeware if you are obviously Jewish, for example if you wear a kippa/yarmulke. Many people who are easily recognisable as Jewish have faced harassment or worse, primarily from that subset of Muslims from within and outside the Paris area who have violent feelings toward Jews. As a result, many of the local Jews no longer wear identifiably Jewish clothing or symbols (such as Star of David pendants) while walking on the street or taking public transportation. The French government is taking this threat very seriously, and recently (as of 2015) assigned thousands of soldiers to guard places throughout France that are considered likely to be in possible danger from terrorists, but there is only so much that can be done to protect people from violence on the street, so consider taking the advice of local Jews regarding your behavior. For example, if you wear a kippa, consider wearing it under a hat that is not identifiably Jewish, or if you find it unacceptable to be in a place where your appearance might put you in danger, consider postponing your trip or going elsewhere.\\n\\n==Respect==\\n\\nIn general, Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant. At the same time, they tend to judge people based on their own rules, mostly based on socio-economic differences. Thus, the best way to get along in Paris is to be on your best behavior, acting like someone who is \"\\'\\'bien eleve\\'\\'\" (well brought up). It will make getting about considerably easier.\\n\\nParisians\\' abrupt exteriors will rapidly evaporate if you display some basic courtesies. A simple \"\\'\\'Bonjour, Madame\\'\\'\" when entering a shop, for example, or \"\\'\\'Excusez-moi\\'\\'\" when trying to get someone\\'s attention, are very important; say \"\\'\\'Pardon\\'\\'\" or better \"\\'\\'je suis desole\\'\\'\" if you bump into someone accidentally or make other mistakes; if you speak French or are using a phrasebook remember to always use the vous form when addressing someone you don\\'t know, may transform the surliest shop assistant into a smiling helper or the grumpiest inhabitant to a helpful citizen. Courtesy is extremely important in France (where the worst insult is to call someone \"\\'\\'mal eleve\\'\\'\", or \"badly brought up\").\\n\\nIf you only learn one long phrase in French a good one would be \"\\'\\'Excusez-moi de vous deranger, monsieur/madame, auriez-vous la gentillesse de m\\'aider?\\'\\'\" (pardon me for bothering you, sir/madam, would you have the kindness to help me?) - this level of extreme politeness is about the closest one can come to a magic wand for unlocking Parisian hospitality. If you know some French, try it! But remember, too, that Parisians have places to go and things to do, so if they have no time and don\\'t answer you, don\\'t take it personally. Many Parisians, given time, will go out of their way to help, especially if you make an effort to speak their language and act polite to them.\\n\\nMost foreigners tend to ignore two basic rules of courtesy in tube and train transport in Paris. If the car is full, and you stand next to the door, you are expected to get down to the platform at a stop so that people inside can find their way out.  Once they have got out, you can go back. However, don\\'t expect the same courtesy from locals and, if the train is full, get ready to get down with enough time in advance. In a corridor, when pushing a door, you are expected to hold it to the next person, so that it won\\'t close abruptly. This rule is strictly observed in the tube, and quite commonly everywhere else.\\n\\nIn addition, if you are traveling to or from the airport or train station and have luggage with you, make certain that you are not blocking the aisles in the train by leaving your bags on the floor. The RER B (which links both Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports to the city) has luggage racks above the seats (on the newer trains, there are no such racks above the seats, but racks dedicated to luggage in between some seats); it is best to use them so you do not block the path of a local who is getting off the train before the airport stop. On the metro and especially in the RER, please don\\'t take up extra seats with your luggage. There are luggage racks and spaces between the seats. Also note that use of the folding seats on the metro is not permitted during peak hours.\\n\\nBe aware that there are hefty fines for littering in Paris, especially with dog droppings.\\n\\n==Connect==\\nOne helpful thing about having official and numbered districts in Paris is that you can easily tell which arrondissement an address is in by its postal code, and can easily come up with the postal code for a Paris address if you know its arrondissement.  The rule is just pre-pend 750 or 7500 to the front of the arrondissement number, with 75001 being the postal code for the 1st and 75011 being the postal code for the 11th, and so on. The 16th has two postal codes, 75016 for the portion south of Rue de Passy and 75116 to the north; all other arrondissements only have one postal code.\\n\\nPhone cards are available from most \"tabacs\" but make sure you know where you can use them when you buy them, as some places still sell the \\'\\'cartes cabines\\'\\' which are hard to use as \\'\\'cabines\\'\\' are rare.\\n\\n===Wi-Fi===\\nThe city of Paris provides \\'\\'\\'free Internet access\\'\\'\\' via 400 Wi-Fi access points throughout the city, including many public parks.  [http://www.paris.fr/portail/Economie/Portal.lut?page_id=7799&document_type_id=5&document_id=29153&portlet_id=17981 Look for the network called \"PARIS_WI-FI_\" (followed by some digits) on your laptop or PDA.]\\n\\nOther options include Starbucks, which is free. There is also McDonald\\'s, Columbus Cafe, and certain Indiana Cafe locations. There is also the [http://www.wistro.fr/WistroPresDeChezVous.aspx Wistro network] which independent coffee chains offer. You can search by arrondissement. In general, a large number of cafes and restaurants offer free Wi-Fi.\\n\\n==Cope==\\n\\nAlthough known as the fashion capital, Paris is actually quite conservative in dress. So if you go out in bright colors expect to be stared at. Also be aware that the French men (and Europeans more generally) do not usually wear shorts shorter than above the knee outside of sporting events. It is not considered indecent but may stand out from the locals; shorts are for \"schoolboys and soccer players\" only.\\n\\n===Airlines===\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Adria Airways | url=http://www.adria.si | email=\\n| address=94 r Saint Lazare 75009 | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=Mon to Fri 9AM to 1PM, 2PM to 5PM, Sat 9AM until noon | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Air France | url=http://www.airfrance.fr | email=\\n| address=30 av Leon Gaumont 75985 | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 36 54 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Air France Agence Opera | url=http://www.airfrance.fr | email=\\n| address=49 av Opera 75002 | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 36 54 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Air France Agence Jardin du Luxembourg | url=http://www.airfrance.fr | email=\\n| address=4 pl Edmond Rostand 75006 | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 36 54 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Air Tahiti Nui | url= | email=\\n| address=28 bd St Germain 75005 | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 825 02 42 02 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Croatia Airlines | url=http://www.croatiaairlines.fr | email=\\n| address=Roissypole Le Dome Bat1 r de la Haye Tremblay en France BP 18913 95731 ROISSY CH DE GAULLE CEDEX | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 48 16 40 00 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Delta Air Lines | url=http://www.delta.com | email=\\n| address=2 r Robert Esnault Pelterie 75007 | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 892 702 609 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Finnair (Compagnie Aerienne de Finlande) | url=http://www.finnair.fr | email=\\n| address=Roissy Terminal 2D 95715 ROISSY CDG CEDEX | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 821 025 111 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=LOT Polish Airlines | url= | email=\\n| address=27 r Quatre Septembre 75002 | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 800 10 12 24 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours=open from Mon to Sun | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Qatar Airways | url= | email=\\n| address=7 r Vignon 75008 | lat= | long= | directions=\\n| phone=+33 1 55 27 80 80 | tollfree= | fax=\\n| hours= | price=\\n| content=\\n}}\\n* {{listing\\n| name=Royal Jordanian airlines | url=http://www.rj.com | email=partorj@rj.com\\n| address=38 avenue des Champs Elysees Paris -

       "<p>Szczecin is Poland's third-largest port and much of its industrial base used to be a part of an important shipyard, so it may come as a surprise to the casual tourist that the city does not lay on a seaside, but rather over the river Odra (German: ''Oder''), some 20 kilometres south of the Baltic Sea as the crow flies, and many more by road. Many visitors to Poland are also unaware of Szczecin's architectural attractiveness, as the large parts of the city were designed by Baron Haussmann, the same gentleman who designed the boulevards of [[Paris]].</p>\n",
       "<p>==Understand==\n",
       "The place now known as Szczecin was first mentioned in written history in 1st century when West-Roman historian Tacitus located East Germanic tribe of Rugians somewhere in the area; the Rugians left in 5th Century during the Great Migration. Sometime in the 8th century Western Slavic tribe of Pomeranians built their stronghold here. In 10th century the town was mentioned as \"one of major in Pomerania\" in Abraham ben Jacob's chronicle. In approximately 1080 its area was incorporated into [[Poland]], but within eight years, the town was controlled by the Dukedom of Pomerania, and five years later, [[Denmark]]. In 12th century when its competitor, [[Wolin]] (also known as Veneta in medieval chronicles) declined Szczecin began to prosper from trade and became one of the major Baltic sea harbours. Its name was first recorded in 1133 as \"Stetin\".</p>\n",
       "<p>In 1181 Pomeranian dukes joined Holy Roman Empire. In 1243 Szczecin got city rights before it became member of the Hanseatic League in 1278. Until early 17th century the city was the capital of Pomeranian Dukedom, then in 1630 when local dukes died out it became part of [[Sweden]],  then Kingdom of Prussia, then for a brief period, due to Napoleon's conquests, the Empire of [[France]]. Beginning in the 18th century, the city constituted as a part of [[Germany]] and served as the \"port of Berlin\". During World War II the city was hit hard by Allied bombers - city centre, Old Town and industrial areas were totally ruined. After the Soviet forces invaded Nazi Germany in 1945, according to Potsdam Conference agreements Poland annexed all lands up to the Oder river, expelling the native German population and ultimately extending the border to include Stettin. Poland thus gained control of the city.</p>\n",
       "<p>In more recent history, the city was (together with [[Tricity]]) one of the birthplaces of Solidarity movement.</p>\n",
       "<p>An unusual feature of Szczecin is its urban planning - many roundabouts and wide avenues. Stettin was rebuilt in 1880's using designs by Georges-Eugene Haussmann, who also did the urban planning for [[Paris]]. His design style is still being used for newly-built (or modified) city areas.</p>\n",
       "<p>The maritime industry is still strong with a busy port and repair shipyard, as well as being a center of service industries in Poland. Situated near the border between Germany and Poland, Szczecin is sometimes considered one of most liberal Polish cities.</p>\n",
